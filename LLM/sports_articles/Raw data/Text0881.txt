This could be a season of destiny for the Harbaugh-led 49ers. See who's in the playoffs, and when they play.
 
   	Roger Goodell believes the NFL grappling with concussions and football-related brain injuries will, in the end, make not just football a safer sport but will extend to all other sports – as well as the U.S. military.
  	In a fan forum with Denver Broncos’ season-ticket holders before the Broncos’ playoff game today against the Baltimore Ravens, Goodell spun one of the darkest periods in NFL history – a time when the league grapples with a spate of ex-players committing suicide and many of those players having suffered from brain disease – into a positive for the future.
  	“We are launching a series of initiatives to make the game safer, and frankly, it will make not just football safer but it will make all sports safer,” Goodell said. “What I believe in so much is our leadership role. We’ve brought attention to the issue of concussions … We’ve had an impact on the military. Traumatic brain injury is a big issue for our veterans and our military personnel. The information we have and we’ve learned, the research we have, we have shared with the defense department."
  	“Those changes are going to make not just football, not just sports, but I think our world safer,” Goodell continued. “And I’m proud of that.”
  	His comments came days after the National Institutes for Health announced that studies of the brain of NFL legend Junior Seau, who committed suicide last year, showed that he suffered from a debilitating brain disease often associated with repeated hits to the head.
