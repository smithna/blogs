The Canaries are looking to bolster their attacking options during the January transfer window, and have lodged bids for Swansea forward Danny Graham as well as Celtic striker Gary Hooper, with an improved offer on what is understood to have been an initial Â£5million deal knocked back by the Scottish club.
  	Leeds frontman Luciano Becchio, who has handed in a transfer request, and QPR forward Jamie Mackie are others said to be on Hughton's radar.
  	Sierra Leone international Kamara had a trial with Stoke in December, but was not offered a deal, and Norwich could now be ready to offer the 28-year-old a chance to play in the English top flight should a deal be struck with the Major League Soccer side.
  	"Kei Kamara is a player we have made enquiries about, but any progress remains behind closed doors," Hughton said at a press conference ahead of Saturday's FA Cup fourth-round tie against Luton.
