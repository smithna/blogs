CRISTIANO Ronaldo last night told his Premier League suitors they will have to wait TWO YEARS to sign him.
 		
Manchester United want Ronaldo back at Old Trafford next season, while City are prepared to pay big bucks to bring the winger to the Etihad.
                                        
                                          But Ronaldo last night dashed their hopes of signing him this summer by insisting he wants to see out his Real Madrid contract, which runs until June 2015. 
                                          
                                          That had been in doubt when he declared he was sad for professional reasons in September, when talks over a new deal first stalled.
                                          
                                          Ronaldo said: "I want to see out my contract at Real Madrid. Im very clear about that.
                                          
                                          After that, well, I dont know whatll happen in the future.
                                          
                                          Am I happy? Honestly, yes. Im doing something I enjoy. I know how fortunate I am and I feel very fulfilled."
                                          
                                         Whatever his long-term plans, Ronaldo will be heading back to Manchester in the near future when his side face United at Old Trafford on March 5.
                                          
                                          Real Madrid will meet them first at the Bernabeu, though, on February 13 for the first leg of their Champions League glamour tie.
                                         
                                          Real have not lifted the trophy since 2002, but no-one has won it more often than the nine-time champions  and Ronaldo has warned United to beware.
                                          
                                          After falling at the last-16 stage for six seasons in a row, Madrid have reached the semi-finals for the last two years under Jose Mourinho and this season they are determined to go all the way, with the final set to take place at Wembley.
                                          
                                          Ronaldo said: Every Madridista wants that 10th European Cup  were more than aware of that.
                                         
                                          Last season we fell just short, which was very frustrating.
                                          
                                          Fortunately we have got the opportunity to set the record straight this year, though the fact we face Manchester United next makes it more difficult.
                                          
                                          Its not going to be easy and I reckon the odds are about 50-50, but Im still very confident.
                                          
                                          No team is unbeatable, but when we are at our best, we are a really good side.
                                         
                                          We know that La Ligas an uphill struggle for us now, but were going to work hard and see what happens.
                                         
                                          Manchester United have started the English championship race very well and are a long way ahead of the rest, but still, if we play the way were capable of, we can beat them.
                                          
                                          To do that we need to pull together and play as a team, like we have done in so many matches before.
