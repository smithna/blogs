   	Jones was brakewoman for Elana Meyers in the women's bobsled portion of an event that also added times in two-man bobsled plus men's and women's skeleton.
  	The U.S. edged Germany by 0.24 seconds even though the Germans won three of four disciplines on the Olympia track.
  	Jones added her first gold medal in her new sport to her two world titles in the indoor 60-meter hurdles, in 2008 and '10.
  	The winning U.S. team included two-man bobsled pilot Steven Holcomb, who earlier Sunday lost his title in his main event to the youngest world champion in history.
  	At 22 years, 270 days, Francesco Friedrich of Germany broke a record set in 1935 by Swiss driver Reto Capadrutt, according to bobsled's world governing body. Holcomb placed fourth.
  	Skeleton racer Noelle Pikus-Pace was 1.7 seconds faster than German rival Marion Thees to lead the U.S. to victory. Canada took bronze, 1.01 seconds behind the Americans' overall time of 4 minutes, 31.29 seconds.
  	
   	Meyers and Jones were the third-fastest in women's bobsled; Holcomb and Curtis Tomasevicz were third in two-man bobsled; and John Daly was seventh-fastest in men's skeleton.
  	After leading the two-day, two-man bobsled competition throughout, Friedrich became the first man to win senior and junior world titles in the same season.
  	Friedrich and brakeman Jannis Baecker were 0.56 seconds faster than silver medalists Beat Hefti and Thomas Lamparter of Switzerland. Friedrich drove to a combined four-run time of 4 minutes, 22.78 seconds.
  	German bronze medalists Thomas Florschuetz and Andreas Bredau trailed Friedrich by 1.19.
  	Holcomb and Steven Langton finished fourth, 0.08 off the podium, after being third in the opening two runs Saturday.
