 		 	The Tampa Bay Rays reinforced their bullpen Thursday, reaching an agreement to re-sign free-agent right-hander Kyle Farnsworth, according to a major-league source.
  	
 	Where did 2012's top free agents land and who's still available?
 
   	Farnsworth, 36, will receive a guarantee of between $1.25 million and $1.5 million plus incentives, the source said. The deal is pending a physical.
  	The Rays know Farnsworth well â€“ he pitched for them the past two seasons. He had a terrific year in 2011, posting a 2.18 ERA in 57 2/3 innings, but was sidelined for two months last season by a right elbow strain.
  	ESPN.com first reported that Farnsworth and the Rays had a deal.
