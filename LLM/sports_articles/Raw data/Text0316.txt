Whenever the Knicks lose, Amar’e Stoudemire can be found in some corner of the locker room with his head down, voice low and legs wrapped like a mummy from the costs of another wasted effort. Stoudemire then pledges that the Knicks have yet to accomplish anything of substance and notes the urgency to snap out of whatever malaise that is on the verge of setting in.

 Stoudemire again backed his sentiments with an on-court statement Sunday by roaming for 41 points in the Knicks’ comfortable 117-103 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers at Madison Square Garden.        
 The Knicks (26-24) avenged a narrow loss to Philadelphia (23-27) two days earlier and regained some cushion between them and the 76ers. They won for the fifth time in their last 15 games behind Stoudemire, who matched his season high, and Landry Fields, who scored a career-high 25 points and had 10 rebounds.        
 “We knew how important this was,” Stoudemire said.        
 He also totaled seven rebounds, four assists and a couple of push-ups when he fell after being whistled for a fourth-quarter foul.        
 “I couldn’t stop Amar’e one-on-one, and as a team, we couldn’t stop him,” said Philadelphia’s Elton Brand, who had a team-high 28 points after scoring 33 in the 76ers’ win on Friday.        
 The Knicks moved the ball better, a point Coach Mike D’Antoni emphasized before the game, and they shot a season-high 59.7 percent and made 11 3-pointers. The Knicks held Philadelphia to 28 rebounds, the lowest by an opponent this season, in part because the Knicks left few to grab.        
 Ultimately, however, there was a bittersweet edge to the afternoon. Stoudemire received his 14th technical in the third quarter from the official Bob Delaney. Stoudemire had poked the ball loose from Spencer Hawes but fouled him. Stoudemire raced up the court in protest, a relatively mild act, but Delaney assessed the technical. The N.B.A. is trying to curtail player complaints.        
 With 32 games left in the regular season, Stoudemire is two technicals away from an automatic one-game suspension.        
 “I hope they look at it and I hope they rescind it,” D’Antoni said. “I don’t know. To me, I don’t know how you play the game without any emotion whatsoever.”        
 The Knicks season’ is chugging along in a rickety pattern of winning streaks and skids. With less than three weeks left until the Feb. 24 trade deadline, the Knicks are in the process of determining whether to try to obtain Carmelo Anthony now, or later through free agency.        
 The latest discussions involve the Minnesota Timberwolves as a facilitator in an Anthony deal, according to two people involved with the talks, who voiced skepticism that it would develop much further. In the proposal, Anthony would go to the Knicks from Denver and the Nuggets would receive Wilson Chandler from the Knicks and Corey Brewer and a first-round draft selection from Minnesota, which would import Anthony Randolph and Eddy Curry’s expiring contract.        
 Minnesota’s possible involvement was first reported by ESPN. It is just the latest in season-long speculation involving Anthony.        
 Any discussion involving Anthony can drag on, as the Nets could attest, and nothing will probably happen until near the trade deadline.        
 “I don’t think we have anything going, but at least we’re getting a feeling of possibilities, let’s put it that way,” Donnie Walsh, the Knicks’ president, said. He added that he was not feeling more confident about a deal, but “we have a better feeling for what’s going to happen.”        
 Anthony’s greatest strength is his scoring. On Sunday, the Knicks needed no such help as six players scored in double digits. Their defensive efforts lapsed again, though, and Philadelphia shot 54.2 percent.        
 The Knicks led throughout the second half, but the 76ers sliced the deficit to 6 points entering the fourth quarter. Chandler and Toney Douglas stretched it back out with 3-pointers. Stoudemire shot 5 for 5 in the fourth quarter, part of his 9-of-10 second-half performance. Fields made three 3-pointers in the fourth quarter.        
 “He either stopped the bleeding or put us ahead,” D’Antoni said. “He’s been playing good all year.”        
 With the Knicks struggling of late, D’Antoni started center Timofey Mozgov for the first time since Nov. 16, when the Knicks had plummeted to 3-7.  D’Antoni acknowledged that he had rushed Mozgov into a starter’s role and reduced him to a sometime part-time and often no-time player.        
 Mozgov had 8 rebounds and 3 points in 30 minutes Sunday.        
 “We would like to get to the point where we have a big lineup out there with Mozgov,” D’Antoni said.        
 REBOUNDS        
 Ronny Turiaf did not play because of a sprained right ankle he sustained on Friday. Turiaf has had myriad mild injuries this season and is considered day to day.
