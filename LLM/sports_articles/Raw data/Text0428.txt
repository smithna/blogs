Welsh boxer Nathan Cleverly has revealed his excitement for his upcoming defence of the WBO world light-heavyweight title against mandatory challenger Robin Krasniqi in March.
 The German fighter will go into the bout with an incredible winning rate, but Cleverly said that his opponent’s desire to win will only spur him on in the build-up to the eagerly awaited contest.
 "He’s a good fighter,” the Welshman told talkSPORT's Paul Hawksbee & Sam Delaney.
He’ll be coming into the fight with a lot of confidence. He really thinks he’s going to win this fight, and I like that— Nathan Cleverly
 “He’s won his last 38 fights, it’s one hell of a winning streak, so he’ll be coming into the fight with a lot of confidence.
 “He really thinks he’s going to win this fight and I like that.
 “I know I’ve got someone in front of me that’s really hungry to win, so I can take that into the gym and train with a buzz because it’s going to be top class.
 “I’m looking forward to it, he’s going to come to fight and I’m prepared.
