This past month I have witnessed yet again just how powerful the platform of sports is as I  traveled throughout South Africa and Namibia conducting clinics for various ages and using  basketball as an avenue to teach valuable life lessons and build communities.
    In order to more accurately depict my experiences, I am going to break my travels into a 3 part  series. The first section will be my time spent with our NBA personnel over in South Africa,  followed by my travels throughout Namibia, and lastly with the small NGO that I have worked  with back in South Africa near the Swaziland border.
        Upon landing in Johannesburg, where the NBA Africa office is headquartered, I was quickly  brought up to speed on the State of Basketball in Africa especially in regards to South Africa  and Namibia. Three things impressed me about how the sport has progressed since my last  visit in 2009. First, I was encouraged to hear that the NBA games are now being aired on an  ordinary national TV station, making it more accessible to the average population in South  Africa. It is a country that joins the rest of the world in their love for football (soccer), add to  that an infatuation with rugby and cricket, and basketball naturally takes a back seat in their  sports realm. Having games on TV raises the awareness for the game that leads to an increase in  participation, which brings me to my second point: the increase in organized leagues, especially  for the youth. The growth of any sport has to be done organically and with a huge emphasis  on grassroots development. Providing more structured leagues for children to play in at an  elementary level will translate to better high school players, more competitive national teams  and most importantly a greater pool of the population to become coaches and invest back in the  next generation.
    My final notable observation was the extraordinary increase in the number of young girls now  playing basketball! The globalization of womens basketball is quite fascinating to me, and  South Africa holds a truly unique chapter in that book. Since the invention by Naismith in 1891,  American women went from playing 3-on-3 in bloomers to the universal game, uniform and  rules we know today in the WNBA. The South African Basketball Federation, on the other hand,  was not even established until 1953, a time when the country was torn apart by Apartheid.  During this period, women were encouraged to play in the similar, yet very different sport of  netball, and even then it was limited to whites only excluding a majority of the population.  Nelson Mandela utilized the platform of sport to unite the country during the 1995 Rugby World  Cup and since then opportunities and equality have been on an upward journey.
    One thing I love about Basketball Without Borders and the NBAs dedication to the grassroots  development of the game of basketball is that girls are included in their vision! Our two-hour  drive took us outside the metropolitan district of Jo-berg, passed the platinum mines to a  beautiful outdoor court where I was greeted by an entire group of young, energetic girls ready  to participate in our skills clinic. Historically my time in South Africa has been working with only  the boys and maybe a girl or two speckled in, so I could barely believe my eyes when I saw an  entire court filled with the Platinum All-Stars of the Royal Bafokeng National, the select girls  from the north region!!
    Like many of the girls attending, Elri Liebenberg, has only been playing basketball for a few  months because previously netball was her only option. At 68 she played the goal shooter  position her whole life, so shifting over to basketball she already has a naturally good shooting  form. Had she been born in the States, she would have been groomed since elementary  school, filtered through the AAU system as she grew up, and by now be getting scholarship  opportunities from every major university, but instead she was raised playing netball, started  playing basketball at the age of 16 where she scored 42 points in her first game, and can still  potentially get a scholarship to play but it will be a much longer journey for her to get there.
    I am not discrediting the kids that I work with back in the United States, but there is just  a different energy and enthusiasm that accompanies being given an opportunity that has  historically never been afforded to someone before, and the pure passion that these girls  displayed captured that ideology! The exciting thing about working with these young girls right  now is that they are on the cusp of a learning curve to establish success on the national level at  a rate that exists in few places in the world. If you wanted to see a tremendous return on your  investment in coaching, spend a little time in Africa. Going from nothing at all to anything, by  sheer definition you will see growth at exponential rates! Right now, the country in Africa whose  President and Minister of Sport commits to investing in girls basketball will quickly dominate the  sport on the continent, I know a lot of young girls who are hoping that will be South Africa!!
