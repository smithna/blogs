LA Galaxy coach Bruce Arena has refused to rule out the possibility of a deal being done for Chelsea veteran Lampard. The MLS outfit have been strongly linked with the England international ever since it became apparent that Lampard would not be offered a contract extension at Stamford Bridge.
  	However, other reports suggest otherwise. "It's all but done," a source told Goal.com earlier in the week.
  	The Galaxy have a place available in their squad for a 'designated player' following the departure of David Beckham. Lampard has been touted as an ideal candidate to fill the void, and Arena concedes that the 34-year-old midfielder does appeal.
  	He has been reluctant to speculate on the likelihood of an agreement being put in place, but has fanned the transfer flames with his latest comments.
  	Arena said: "I wouldn't be surprised if over the next week or so we're going to have some sort of decision with a designated player. We wouldn't rule a move for Lampard out. It's always a possibility."
  	
   	During Chelsea's trip to North America last year, the England international expressed interest in playing for Major League Soccer when asked about his future with the Stamford Bridge club.
  	“I am not sure [about a future in MLS],” Lampard said. “I have another year on my contract at Chelsea and we have a big season ahead of us with the Super Cup and the Club World Cup in December. It’s up to Chelsea to speak with me about my future and, at that time, I’ll speak with them.
  	“I wouldn’t rule anything out at the moment.”
