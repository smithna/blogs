Allardyce's current deal expires at the end of the season, but Gold insists the club        will not enter talks about extending the contract         of the former Blackburn Rovers and Bolton Wanderers manager until the Hammers have secured Premier League safety. 
                   "We will sit down and discuss Sam's contract situation once our Premier League status has been confirmed and not before," he said in a statement. 
                   "This is purely because the three of us [Allardyce, Gold and co-chairman David Sullivan] don't want anything to distract attention from our aim of finishing as high up the league table as possible." 
                   West Ham are 11th in the Premier League with 30 points, but have        won only one of their last six league games.
