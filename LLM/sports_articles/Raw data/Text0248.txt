No question about it, we got battered by Liverpool last Sunday  it was embarrassing and its not ideal preparation for Wembley.
 					 						
   		SWANSEAS Garry Monk aims to win the Capital One Cup at Wembley to ease the pain of their 5-0 hammering at Liverpool.
 		
The club captain believes a first major trophy in the Welsh sides 101-year history against Bradford on Sunday will quickly make amends with the fans.
                                        
                                          Monk said: "No question about it, we got battered by Liverpool last Sunday  it was embarrassing and its not ideal preparation for Wembley.
                                          
                                          Its a wake-up call. We know Bradford are no mugs but if we beat them and lift the cup then the Liverpool result will be quickly forgotten by our supporters."
                                          
                                          Swans stalwart Monk, who is competing with Kyle Bartley  to partner Ashley Williams in defence at Wembley, added: "Winning would be the best thing in the world.
                                          
                                          It would be the icing on the cake for me because Ive come from playing in the bottom league to playing in the Premier League with Swansea.
                                          
                                          Ive got a LDV Vans medal, the Football League One trophy, won the Welsh Cup twice and the play-off final as well as winning the Under-16 Pioneer League! 
                                         
                                          But none of them come anywhere near winning at Wembley on Sunday. 
                                          
                                          To have a cup winners medal around your neck is something you dream of as a kid and it would be the biggest medal for any of the players in our dressing room. 
                                          
                                          This is what we are in football for, to win things  so hopefully we can win the cup."
