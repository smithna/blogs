MELBOURNE, Australia -- Nick Kyrgios won an all-Aussie final to capture the boys singles title at the Australian Open on Saturday, while 15-year-old Ana Konjuh of Croatia took home the girls singles and doubles championships.
  	The 17-year-old Kyrgios beat his friend and doubles partner, 16-year-old Thanasi Kokkinakis, 7-6 (4), 6-3 on Australia Day, the national holiday.
  	It was the first all-Australian boys final at Melbourne Park since Ben Ellwood defeated Andrew Ilie in 1994.
  	Konjuh, who had former French Open champion and Croatia Fed Cup captain Iva Majoli supporting her from the stands at Rod Laver Arena, defeated 16-year-old Katerina Siniakova of the Czech Republic 6-3, 6-4.
  	Konjuh is the third girl in the past three years to win both the singles and doubles titles at the Australian Open, following An-Sophie Mestach of Belgium in 2011 and American Taylor Townsend last year.
  	She will also rise to the top of the junior rankings after the tournament.
  	"Just the feeling is incredible," Konjuh said. "That experience, the crowd, you know, it's all a big thing. I just hope in the future I'm going to come back."
  	Konjuh combined with Carol Zhao of Canada to win the girls doubles title.
  	Kyrgios said it was an honor to play on Rad Laver Arena the day after Andy Murray edged Roger Federer in five sets in the men's semifinals on Friday night.
  	"It was obviously a great experience being out there knowing that Federer and Murray were grinding it out the night before," Kyrgios said. "I thought the level of tennis out there today was really good. Didn't seem that we were really nervous."
  	An Australian pair, Jay Andrijic and Bradley Mousley, won the boys doubles title.
