Seton Hall women's basketball coach Anne Donovan is returning to the WNBA to coach the Connecticut Sun.

Donovan, who won a WNBA championship with Seattle in 2004, said Thursday she plays to step down from her job at Seton Hall at the end of the season to take the job in Connecticut.

Donovan, who was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1995, also has coached Indiana, Charlotte and New York in the WNBA, compiling a 167-150 record in 10 seasons. She earned two Olympic gold medals as a player and coached the United States to a gold medal in the 2008 Olympic games.

Donovan replaces Mike Thibault who was fired in November after leading Connecticut to eight playoff appearances, but no championships in 10 seasons.

Seton Hall is 5-8 this season.
