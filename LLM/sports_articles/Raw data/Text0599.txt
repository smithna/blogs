Currently the head coach at Seton Hall University, Donovan will resign from that position and begin her new duties with the Sun at the conclusion of the 2013 college basketball season. 
  I am really excited to join the Connecticut Sun, one of the premier franchises in the WNBA, Donovan said Thursday. The leadership team of Mitchell Etess and Chris Sienko has built a winning tradition in a fan-friendly environment that offers one of the best home court advantages in the WNBA. I am excited to coach and lead this talented roster of players on the Suns quest for a WNBA championship. 
    Donovan brings an impressive resume to Connecticut. 
     A member of the 1995 Naismith Hall of Fame class, she won Olympic gold medals as both a player (1984 and 88) and coach (2008). 
    Her WNBA coaching career includes a championship with the Seattle Storm in 2004, an appearance in the Finals with the Charlotte Sting in 2001 and a total of seven playoff berths with three teams over 10 years. She has an overall regular season record of 167-150 (.527). 
    "We are absolutely thrilled to bring someone of Anne's caliber to the Connecticut Sun, team Vice President and General Manager Chris Sienko said. Anne is a proven winner as both an athlete and as a coach. Our team will benefit greatly from her experience as we move into a new era." 
    A native of Ridgewood, N.J., the 6-foot-8 Donovan went on to a storied career as star center at Old Dominion, where she was a three-time Kodak All-American (1981-83), two-time Academic All-American (1982-83) and Naismith Trophy winner (1983). She helped the Monarchs win the 1980 AIAW National Championship, and graduated with the ODU career records for points (2,710) and rebounds (1976). Her 801 blocked shots are still an NCAA record. 
    This is an extremely exciting day for the Connecticut Sun, team CEO Mitchell Etess said. Anne is someone who has achieved remarkable success as both a player and coach, and there is no doubt she is the right person to guide us as we begin our 11th season in the WNBA."
