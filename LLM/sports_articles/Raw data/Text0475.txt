HOUSTON: Kevin Durant  and Blake Griffin  provided a potent mix of outside shooting and inside dominance to lift the Western Conference to a 143-138 victory over the Eastern Conference in the NBA  All-Star game Sunday.
    Durant scored 30 points and Griffin added 19, on nine-of-11 shooting, but the Most Valuable Player Award  went to Chris Paul, who scored 20 points and added 15 assists for the West.
    Paul told Durant, the NBA’s leading scorer and last year’s All-Star game MVP, to expect to see the ball in his hands. “I told KD early in the first quarter, ‘Man, if they score anything, you run. I’ll get you the ball, you score. I want to be the one to give it to you,’” recalled the Los Angeles Clippers  guard. “In games like this it’s so up-tempo and fast paced, a guy like me that’s a facilitator, I enjoy it.”
    Carmelo Anthony  of the New York Knicks paced the East with 26 points, followed by Miami guard Dwyane Wade, who had 21, and LeBron James, who added 19.
    Durant hit 13-of-24 shots to lead the West to a third straight victory in the annual showcase that features little defense, a lot of dunks, and plenty of assists for anyone who decides to pass.
    “I’m just out there having fun,” Oklahoma City forward Durant said. “I played a lot of street basketball. I played a lot of celebrity games.
    “This is my type of ballgame, up and down.”
    Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant, a three-time MVP of the game, dueled James several times in the fourth quarter and came out on top. James nailed seven-of-18 shots but misfired on all four fourth-quarter attempts.
    James, a forward with the Miami Heat, said he was not startled to see the smaller Bryant guarding him with the game on the line.
    “He does it all the time,” James said. “I am absolutely not surprised. It was all in good spirit. It was just two guys that love to compete, love to go at it. It was a lot of fun.”
    The West held a three-point, fourth-quarter lead but a 25-foot, 3-pointer by Paul, a driving layup by Bryant, and a dunk by Durant pushed the lead to 136-126 with 2:34 left.
    Anthony said at halftime with the West leading 69-65 his East team mates decided “we were going to go after it.”
    “Everybody competed,” he said. “We get guys out there of that caliber, they’re going to compete. Nobody likes to lose.
    “At the end of the day, we’re all basketball players, we’re all competitors,” Anthony added.
    The sellout Toyota Center  crowd of 16,101 roared its approval at the array of alley-oop baskets, sprints to the hoop, and the rim-rattling dunks by Griffin, Paul’s teammate with the Clippers.
    West coach Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs praised both teams, saying: “Those guys are the best in the world and they competed and worked hard ... They respected the game. They respected each other. Nobody got hurt.”
