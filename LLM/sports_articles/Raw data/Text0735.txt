  	It’s not surprising that the five-time GrandAm champ — who won the series’ last three titles — puts as much effort into his Auburn, Calif. winery as he does his racing.
  	Wine Spectator Magazine recently named Pruett Vineyards one of the top-10 winemakers to watch in the future. Obviously, Pruett is as driven in the vineyard as he is on the racetrack.
  	“When Scott isn’t racing or working out, he’s in the vineyard,” Judy Pruett joked. “I’m either a race widow or a wine widow.”
  	Pruett, 52, won the pole for this weekend’s Rolex 24 at Daytona, an event he’s won four times (five times in the DP class). On Sunday, Pruett hopes to tie Hurley Haywood’s record of five event titles in what is considered the Super Bowl of American sports car racing.
  	After his first stint in the Chip Ganassi Racing BMW, he spoke of his recent accolades in Wine Spectator Magazine. Pruett Vineyard scored 93 points for their 2010 Lucky Lauren in WSM’s list of 10 affordable California Rhones.
  	“It’s very exciting from the Pruett Vineyard side of it because we do all the work,” Pruett said. “I do all the winemaking. Our family does the bottling, the labeling, the corking — everything gets done at the house. We’re very small, 500 cases a year.
  	"When we submitted our wines, our first release which was a year ago, two of our wines — our Estate Syrah and our Reserve Syrah — both received 91 points right out of the box. Which is very exciting, especially for Wine Spectator, who’s arguably one of the most difficult global wine raters around.
