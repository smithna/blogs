Angel Reyna scored a genuinely superb goal for Pachuca against Cruz Azul in Mexico - but then capped it with a celebration that was even better.
 After just three minutes of the Mexican Liga MX clash, Reyna smashed in a simply wonderful 40-yard half-volley that screamed into the top corner of the net.
 The striker, on loan from Monterrey, then teamed up with team-mate Dario Carreno for a celebration that more resembled something you would see in a WWE ring as opposed to a football pitch.
 We are reliably informed by our wrestling expert that the move in question is called a "Hurricanrana". If we're wrong on that, no doubt you'll feel free to let us know in the comments box below.
 Pachuca went on to win the match 2-1 with Ecuadorian international Christian Suarez getting the winner in the 77th minute.
 Pachuca currently lie fifth in the league table after seven matches.
