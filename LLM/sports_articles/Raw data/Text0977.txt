GARY ALEXANDER has told everyone at AFC Wimbledon to stick together in their bid to escape the drop.

he striker, on loan from Crawley, netted a last-gasp winner for the League's bottom side to send Dons fans into ecstasy and dent the Wembley build-up for Bradford.

Wimbledon's home form has been so poor that the win was their ?rst since October – and their ?rst on a Saturday since the opening day.

"We've just got to stick together and take the rough with the smooth, and hopefully at the end of the season we've done enough," said Alexander.

"To nick a 90th minute winner is fantastic, and it's a big buzz for the lads for Tuesday against Northampton. 

"We needed that win, and obviously we've got the monkey off our back at home.

"I can't credit the team enough. Going a goal behind we could have quite easily folded. But we came back at them and scored the goal, and it gave us a little bit of a lift."

While Bradford will spend this week preparing for Swansea, Wimbledon face two more crucial games, against the Cobblers and Dagenham.

"It's de?nitely a springboard for us for the rest of the season," added Alexander. 

"We know what we've got to do – we've got 15 games. We've spoken about it as a bunch of lads, and we've had it out in the last couple of weeks.

"There are ?ve or six teams down there, obviously we're one of them and we want to pick up points and put the other teams under pressure."

The Dons have been struggling at the wrong end of the Football League for most of the season, due in part to letting in sloppy goals.

Alan Bennett was the guilty party this time, heading short towards Neil Sullivan and allowing Gary Thompson in for his fourth goal of the season.

However, with seven minutes left, sub Jack Midson grabbed his 10th goal of the season to give Wimbledon a glimmer of hope.

The crunch came right on the ?nal whistle, when Alexander bundled home to send Dons fans wild.

The result was a painful one for the Bantams, who certainly did not take it easy before their big date at Wembley.

Having kept the same side that beat Wycombe 3-0 in the week, boss Phil Parkinson admitted it was tempting to make major changes for Sunday's ? nal.

"If we change things too much that will be the wrong thing to do – we will train as normal and prepare as professionally as we can," he said.

"We are going to enjoy the experience and the lads deserve it – they have worked exceptionally hard. 

"Swansea are an outstanding football team so we won't have much of the ball. We will have a real go and that is all we can do.

"I don't think Wembley showed in the way we played. 

"We were good all round – we were strong, and I couldn't fault the lads today.

"To concede two goals in the last few minutes is real tough."
