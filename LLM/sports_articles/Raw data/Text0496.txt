SPANISH starlet Isco has sparked a scramble for his signature by admitting he would be happy to leave current club Malaga.
 		
The 20-year-old signed a new contract with the cash-strapped La Liga side last month.
                                          But the move was merely seen as a bid by Malaga to extract more money for their prize asset this summer.
                                          Isco's new deal contains a Â£30m release clause, with the club's Qatari owners hoping a bidding war for the attacking midfielder will break out at the end of the season.
                                          Malaga have been banned from European competition next term, after their financial difficulties left them unable to pay wages at one point last year.
                                          And Isco knows that his side's perilous book-keeping could mean he is sold in the near future.
                                          In an interview with Spanish newspaper AS, Isco revealed he would have no problem leaving Malaga, if a deal was in their best interest. 
                                          "If it's helping Malaga, I would have no problem in accepting an outcome that was good for both," he said.
                                          Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson is thought to have targeted the Spanish international as an ideal replacement for veteran Paul Scholes.
                                          But Barcelona, Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham are all likely to compete for the highly-rated playmaker.
