The 28-year-old missed just one target in the range on his way to a winning time of 39:48.7minutes with Fourcade unable to catch him in the dying stages.
Fourcade, who won the pursuit in Oslo, had to make do with second 13.7seconds back after three penalties while German Erik Lesser trailed by 16.8 overall but took third.
And, while he hadn't yet claimed a World Cup win, Moravec was confident he could hold off the charge of World Cup leader Fourcade at the death.
"That was perfect for me; my first victory it is like a dream come true. I tried to enjoy it all. This has been a great season for our team and I think it will continue," he said.
"I was a little tired at the beginning, but then I found some energy on the last hills. I was confident I could hold Martin off."
Fourcade led Moravec by over seven seconds heading into the final shoot but, having gone clear up until that point, he missed two targets in the range to surrender the lead.
He is still very much the World Cup champion elect with a lead of 261 points at the top and five races left this season with Fourcade gracious in defeat in Oslo.
"He was really strong on the last loop. I really felt good on my skis, except in the last loop. My mind wanted it but my legs did not want it; it was hard to bring them together," he said.
"I take a lot of pleasure on my skis in training and the races. It is never hard for me to go out there. I am a happy man."
