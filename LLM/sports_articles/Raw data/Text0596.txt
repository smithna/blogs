The Bees of Brentford did not just sting the pride of the Blues yesterday, they also put another huge dent in their fragile confidence.
                    
                     It took an 83rd-minute strike from Fernando Torres  his only attempt on goal  to rescue him, the team and manager Rafa  Benitez from an embarrassment that would have dwarfed the defeat by bottom club QPR and humbling by Swansea in the Capital One Cup.
                     
Play-off hopefuls Brentford sent out a team including just three players who cost a fee, six free signings and two who are on loan.
                     
                     Benitez picked a surprisingly strong 11 for Chelseas 40th game of the season, leaving Demba Ba and Juan Mata on the bench  and he had to bring both on, Ba in the 82nd minute, Mata at half-time.
                     
                     Uwe Roslers Brentford were twice in the lead, through goals from Marcello Trotta in the 43rd minute and a penalty from Harry Forrester in the 73rd.
                     
                     Oscar and Torres  two players who cost £75m between them  kept holders Chelsea in the competition and secured a replay at Stamford Bridge in two weekends time on fifth-round day. It was a blustery day at Griffin Park, a cramped stadium still ­surrounded by houses with pubs on all four corners of the ground.
                    
                     The pitch was hardly an award-winning one either, with large patches covered with  sand. 
                     
In short, it was not the sort of place the multi-millionaires of Chelsea are used to.
                     
                     The Bees were up for it, but some of the delicate flowers from the Premier League clearly were not and boy did it show  ­particularly in the first half.
                     
                     Chelseas Marko Marin, in particular, looked like a boy amongst men and it was no surprise the German international was hooked at half-time. But even stalwarts Frank Lampard and John Terry did not seem like they wanted to be out there for this high noon encounter.
                     
                     The early exchanges saw Brentford  create half-chances and there was an ­embarrassing mix-up in the 12th minute between Terry and keeper Ross Turnbull.
                     
                     Under pressure from the excellent ­Clayton Donaldson, skipper Terry passed back to his keeper, who picked up the ball.
                    
                     Forrester, though, having been teed up from the free-kick just inside the box, could only blaze over. 
                     
                     Champions of Europe, youre having a laugh, went out the cry, after Gary Cahill sent an attempted pass straight into touch. 
                     
                     Brentford got the goal they deserved ­following a fine tackle by Adam Forshaw on Lampard 30 yards out.
                     
                     Forresters right-foot shot was well struck and Turnbull could only parry weakly to Trotta.
                     
                     The Italian striker on loan from Fulham followed up to drive the rebound into the ground and in with his right boot. 
                     
                     Chelsea stepped it up after the break and equalised through Oscar. The Brazilian showed class to evade two challenges and poked home high into the net from just ­inside the box. 
                    
                     Just a minute after coming on for goal hero Trotta, Tom Adeyemi was brought down by Turnbull, who dashed off his line following a terrific through ball from ­Donaldson. Forrester calmly stroked the penalty low past the keeper. 
                     
Benitez surprised many by taking off Branislav Ivanovic straight after he  almost scored with an overhead kick and replacing him, like for like, with Cesar Azpilicueta.
                     
                     Rafa Benitez, youre not wanted here, was the response from the travelling ­support.
                     
                     Ba did come on in the 82nd minute, for Ryan Bertrand not Torres, and it was just as well. The Spaniard delivered a minute later, lashing home from the edge of the box after Ba hooked it to his fellow striker.
                     
                     In stoppage time a Mata cross struck Harlee Dean on the arm inside the penalty area. 
                     
                     Chelsea went barmy at the lack of a penalty award, but to see the Bees beaten at the death would have been too cruel.
