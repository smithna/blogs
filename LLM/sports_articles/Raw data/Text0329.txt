 		 	Marcus Lattimore isn’t healthy enough to participate in the pre-draft process, but the star South Carolina running back’s chance to impress NFL scouts is coming soon enough.
  	
 	Yeah, the Harbaughs will be the media darlings. But don't sleep on these names come Super Bowl XLVII.
 
   	Lattimore said Tuesday night that he is planning to conduct a workout in early April to show the progress made from a major knee injury suffered in late October.
  	“I’m on pace to do that,” Lattimore told me and co-host Jim Miller on SiriusXM NFL radio. “I’m going to start jogging in two weeks and I’m real excited about it.”
  	Lattimore attended Senior Bowl practice on Tuesday to briefly meet with NFL teams and offer a progress report on his rehabilitation. Lattimore tore ligaments and dislocated his right knee against Tennessee. He tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee the previous season.
  	Lattimore was one of college football’s top rushers as a freshman in 2010 when tallying 1,197 yards and 17 touchdowns. Lattimore got off to strong starts in 2011 and 2012 before having both campaigns ended prematurely.
  	Although that history of knee problems is likely to hurt his draft stock, Lattimore’s drive to play at a high level once again should impress interested suitors. Lattimore has set returning to the field for the 2013 NFL season opener as his goal in rehab.
