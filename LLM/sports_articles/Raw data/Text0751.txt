A Chelsea offer would be hard to resist for the boss who has been LMA Manager of the Year on three occasions while operating on a restricted budget at Everton.
 					 						
   		DAVID MOYES is emerging as a genuine candidate to become manager of Chelsea in the summer.
 		
Rafa Benitez, Chelseas interim boss until the end of the season, is not wanted by the Stamford Bridge fans.
                                        
                                          And if Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich looks elsewhere for his next manager, Evertons Moyes will be in the frame to become the Russians first British boss.
                                          
                                          Moyes, 49, would be a contender, along with Borussia Dortmunds Jurgen Klopp and possibly Real Madrids former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho.
                                          
                                          His Goodison contract is up at the end of the season and Moyes has to decide whether to continue his 11-year  relationship with the club  or make a career-changing decision.
                                          
                                          Moyes has revealed he has ambitions  to manage in  Germanys  Bundesliga one day  but it could be a case first of London calling.
                                          
                                         The Everton boss enjoys a special relationship with Goodison chairman Bill Kenwright which would be difficult to end.
                                          
                                          But a Chelsea offer would be hard to resist for the boss who has been LMA Manager of the Year on three occasions while operating on a restricted budget at Everton.
                                         
                                          Chelsea also have an interest in an Everton player  Belgiums Marouane Fellaini.
                                          
                                          Benitez, meanwhile, goes into todays FA Cup tie at Brentford knowing he probably needs to win the competition, qualify for the Champions League and possibly succeed in the Europa League, too, to have a chance of extending his stay at Chelsea.
                                          
                                          Meanwhile, Moyes contract stalemate with Everton has been labelled disappointing by Goodison Park legend Alan Stubbs.
                                         
                                          Former Toffees star Stubbs, now a reserve team coach at the club, said: The manager has got his destiny in his own hands now. 
                                          
                                          Hes done a fantastic job. Hes basically irreplaceable  but hes probably looking at his career and looking for that next challenge.
