Struggling Louisville will be without starting forward Wayne Blackshear and reserve guard Kevin Ware when the No. 12 Cardinals take on Pittsburgh in Monday night's Big East Conference matchup.

The Cardinals announced Monday that Blackshear, averaging 9.2 points and 3.9 rebounds per contest while starting 19 of 20 games, is expected to be out for a ''short period'' after spraining his right shoulder in practice on Sunday.

Ware has been suspended indefinitely for an unspecified reason. He was averaging 3.8 points and nearly 16 minutes a game.

The Cardinals (16-4, 4-3 Big East) have lost three in a row and fallen 11 spots since being ranked No. 1 two weeks ago.
