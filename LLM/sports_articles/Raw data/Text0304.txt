Cub Swanson, who faces Dustin Poirier in a much-anticipated
featherweight bout at Wembley Arena a week on Saturday, revealed he
felt insulted by the newly-created UFC rankings published this week.
The American, who stormed through 2012 with three victories by
knockout, has no issue however with Anthony Pettis gaining an
immediate title contender fight against champion Jose Aldo, after
offering to step down from lightweight.
“It is what it is [Pettis getting the title shot against Aldo in
August],” he told me this week. “I expect to be in the title mix in
the next 8 to 10 months, but I don’t think about it too much. It’s
going to come.”
“I’ve endured a lot, and I’m still here. It’s my time. I’m firing on
all cylinders, I’m stepping into my prime, and whether I get it this
year, next year, or the year after, it’s going to happen. That’s my
goal.”
Initially due to face Dennis Siver at Wembley on Feb 16, that changed
when the Russian suffered a training camp injury. Poirier was
immediately inserted in the blank.
“At first I was bummed when the fight was called off, but when they
gave me the name I thought it was cool. He’s a tall southpaw and I’ve
been wanting to face different opponents with different styles. This
is a fight I wanted.”
But the newly-released UFC media rankings rankled with him. “I didn’t
agree with them. I didn’t feel Dennis Siver should have been ahead of
me. And I didn’t feel that the Korean Zombie [Chan Sung Jung] should
be ahead of me.”
Swanson is currently ranked at No 6, with Chan Sung Jung No 3 and Siver No 5.
“I don’t feel like Dennis Siver did enough to get up that high, he
wasn’t ranked that high in the lightweight division. And he hasn’t
fought the toughest guys. And I feel the same with the Zombie.”
So where does he see his contest between himself and Poirier in the
division. No 2 versus No 3 ? “I don't know. Poirier was up there but
after he lost, he got bumped back a bit, but I feel he’s definitely
top 10. I feel I should definitely be ranked higher than him right
now.”
“Seeing as my only loss in the UFC is to Ricardo Lamas, I should be
higher. People write that I got destroyed by Lamas, but if you look
back at that fight, I was winning it, but I made a mistake, and he
caught me. I’ve worked not to let that happen again.”
Those three wins – three knockouts of Charles Oliveira, Ross Pearson
and George Roop in 2012 – have brought Swanson a maturity, a greater
calmness in preparation for fights.
“I used to want to be the toughest dude out there, I don’t feel that’s
necessary any more. I’ve proved I’m tough. I can be an intelligent
fighter. It makes for a better overall fighter,” he explained.
“I’ve been able to outsmart my opponents, and that’s the reason I’ve
been winning. I’ve been throwing those power shots when it’s right to
finish them. I’m training smarter.”
Swanson leaves for the UK tomorrow, intent on fully acclimatizing to
the time difference from his native Palm Springs, California, over a
full week in London.
“I used to be miserable for a whole week before the fight, so I intend
to enjoy myself for a week in London before the fight. As long as the
weather is good.”
“One thing I’ve learned, taking a page out of Clay Guida’s book after
training with that guy, is to enjoy your time in the UFC. Every minute
of it. I’m not going to turn into a mean animal until the day of the
fight. I don’t have a problem turning the switch,” he explained.
