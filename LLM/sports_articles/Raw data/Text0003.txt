Doubles duo Heather Watson and Jocelyn Ray saved Great Britain's blushes in the Fed Cup in Israel with a dramatic win over Denmark.

The pair secured Britain's place in Europe/Africa Group I after Anne Keothavong lost 6-0 6-2 to world number one Caroline Wozniacki.
Heather Watson opened the tie in style when she overcame Denmark's Karen Barbat 6-0 6-1, but it was not enough for either nation to secure a safe passage in the group so it came down to the doubles decider.
Denmark fielded Wozniacki and Mai Grage with the combination working early as the Danes took the first set 7-5.
Watson and Ray rallied, however, winning the final two sets 7-57-5.
With safe passage now assured Britain rest easy when they take on Croatia on Saturday to determine the final seeding for the 15-team event.
