JACK WILSHERE claims Arsenal must take inspiration from Chelsea's fighting spirit if they are to save their season.
 		
The Gunners were beaten 1-0 by Blackburn in a humiliating FA Cup shocker at the Emirates on Saturday.
                                          Now their last chance of silverware is the Champions League, with Bayern Munich in north London tomorrow for the first leg of their last 16 clash.
                                          Arsene Wenger's struggling side are overwhelming underdogs - but so were Chelsea when they won the tournament against the odds last season.
                                          And Arsenal midfielder Wilshere reckons they could still end their trophy drought if they all band together like the Blues.
                                          He said: "Chelsea are an inspiration because they were not having a good season last year.
                                          ''Okay, they got a bit lucky in some games but they showed great team spirit and character and we need to do that.
                                          "We need to come together as a team. We have good leaders and a good team atmosphere and that's going to help us.
                                          "We have a good bunch of lads in the dressing room and we have winners as well, the likes of Lukas Podolski and Mikel Arteta.
                                         "Everyone said the FA Cup was our best chance of a trophy. Obviously it wasn't but we have to regroup now for a big game tomorrow."
                                          It doesn't get much more daunting than Bayern, who are 18 points clear in the Bundesliga and unbeaten in their last 20 games.
                                          Wilshere said: "We know what Bayern are capable of because they have a great team, and that's why we need everyone behind us when we face them.
                                          "It's not ideal to go into a game like that after the loss to Blackburn but we have to put that behind us and show character.
                                          "We've beaten big European teams here before so we need to do it again.
                                          "We need a good defensive display and then we have to counter them well, so it will be an interesting game."
                                          Gunners defender Thomas Vermaelen also appealed for angry Arsenal fans not to turn on their team, and insisted they can still win the Champions League.
                                          He said: "It is realistic, why not? You need a bit of luck but I believe in our chances.
                                          "Anything can happen in the Champions League - we saw that last year with Chelsea, who had difficult games against Barcelona and Bayern Munich.
                                          "It is a tournament so anything can happen, and there is the same pressure on us as there was against Blackburn.
                                          "They defended really well - they came for a draw I think and got the win.
                                          "I think Bayern will come out of their box so it will be a different game than against Blackburn and the tempo should be higher.
                                          "Sometimes you get more space when the other team comes out more.
                                          ''We need the fans tomorrow. It's normal they are disappointed, and the players are as well.
                                          "But we have to get over the disappointment and work towards Tuesday.
                                          "We need their support and for them to believe as well - the players do and the team does."
