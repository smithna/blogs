JENSON BUTTON is all geared up to snatch back the Formula One world crown he last claimed four years ago.
 		
And he vows: "If McLaren give me the car, Ill do the job."
                    
                     Button, 33 (right) plans to take up where he left off in the last race in Brazil  as a winner.
                     
                     "I cant wait for the new season," he said. 
                     
                     "I never lose that feeling of excitement in the build up to a new season. I feel refreshed and raring to go."
                     
                     The keep-fit fanatic, who finished fifth in last seasons championship, revealed he has been in Hawaii putting himself through a rigorous Olympian-level work-out schedule.
                     
                     "Ive been doing lots  of training  but in a relaxed way. Ive been doing plenty of work outdoors which makes it more fun and also seeing plenty of friends for some great meals."
                     
                     And he revealed he even managed to run a marathon on top of an intensive multi-miles cycling programme ahead of the upcoming try-out of the new car.
                     
                     Button, 15 times a career winner, added: The start of the winter break always feels so long and open-ended.
                     
                     Before you know it you are looking at the calendar and making plans to get back into the car  and Ive never lost that enthusiasm throughout my career.
                     
                     After Lewis Hamiltons shock departure to Mercedes, Button plans to make himself number one at McLaren and says: Having won the last race of 2012 in Sao Paulo it would be perfect to  win the first  race in 2013.
