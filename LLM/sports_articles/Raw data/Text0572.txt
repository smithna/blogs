With six seconds remaining in the second quarter Tuesday night, the Dallas Mavericks and Portland Trail Blazers took the court for what both teams figured would be the final play of the half.
Mavericks point guard Darren Collison, with his team leading 59-44, took the inbounds pass up the court and began driving to the basket when he was bumped by Portland guard Ronnie Price.
Whistles blew for what looked like Portland taking a foul that they had to give, but then officials started to signal that a technical foul was being called.
As the Mavericks lined-up to take the free throw, former Maverick great and current color commentator Derek Harper, pointed out that the Mavericks were playing with a slight advantage on the previous play.
Dallas was called for having six men on the court.
Often only seen in football and hockey, replays showed that, in fact, Dallas had six men on the court against Portland's five.
Collison, Dirk Nowitzki, O.J. Mayo, Vince Carter, Shawn Marion and Brandon Wright were the culprits on the play.
Portland did not capitalize on the mistake though, missing the ensuing free throw before possession returned to Dallas.
"That's about as bizarre as it's gonna get," Harper said.
