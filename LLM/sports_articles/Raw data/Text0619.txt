BRIAN McDERMOTT has tipped Ryan Giggs to be the next Manchester United player to bridge the gap between the dressing room and the dug-out.
 		
The Reading manager spoke of the 39-year-old winger on the eve of taking his Premier League strugglers to Old Trafford tonight for their FA Cup fifth round tie.
                                          "I met him recently at Burton. He was doing his pro-licence and he has got all the ingredients to be a top manager," said McDermott.
                                          "I was really impressed, he came up to me and shook my hand. He is humble and quiet.
                                          "I asked him how many medals he had won. He was very blase and just said 12.
                                          "When I asked what he did with them all, he said they were in museums. He was a really polite man."
                                          McDermott, 51, knows he is unlikely to reach the heights of Sir Alex Ferguson, but he is relishing the opportunity to come face-to-face with the legendary boss.
                                          "He is enthusiastic and it summed it up for me when he came to our game against Stoke," he said.
                                          "He wanted to see the opposition and that tells you everything you need to know about the man.
                                          "I've read a lot on Bill Shankly and what he did, Jock Stein too. Sir Alex Ferguson has to be right up there. He's the figure-head of that club. From when he took over to where they are now is incredible.
                                          "He's a top guy too and I have a lot of time for him, he's good company.
                                          "It's funny, but I think this game means more to me than the players. I'm older and I'm off to manage a side at Manchester United.
                                          "When you're younger, you think these things will happen year in and out but sometimes that is not the case.
                                          "The players' attitude is great, but I appreciate the opportunity to walk out at Old Trafford.
                                          "I will aways appreciate that and look back at it. I appreciate every single day, but when you're younger, you don't. You think it will last forever, so it's a different mindset."
                                          United fan Adam Le Fondre, Royals' top-scorer with 12 goals this season, is likely to get a dream start.
                                          But McDermott has told the super-sub that he has no chance of playing in goal for Reading after impressing between the sticks in a training session during the club's mid-season break in the Middle East last week.
                                          He added: "He was in goal in Dubai and is a really bubbly character.
                                          "He wants to put the gloves on now, but I've decided he won't play in goal at Old Trafford, but he did make some good saves.
                                          "He wouldn't be good on crosses though."
