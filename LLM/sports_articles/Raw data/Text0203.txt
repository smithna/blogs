 		 	The San Francisco Giants avoided salary arbitration with reigning National League MVP Buster Posey, agreeing with him on a one-year, $8 million contract, a major-league source confirmed Friday.
  	
   	An even larger deal could be in the works. The Giants may try to sign Posey to a multiyear extension before Opening Day. The Giants' goal is to keep Posey in San Francisco beyond the end of the 2016 season, when he is scheduled to become a free agent.
  	The San Francisco Chronicle first reported the agreement.
