After being trialled at the Club World Cup in December, FIFA have decided to roll it out at this summer's Confederation's Cup and next year's World Cup.
                    
                       FIFA said in a statement: "After a successful implementation of Goal-Line Technology (GLT) at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan in December 2012, FIFA has decided to use GLT at the FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil 2013 and 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil.
                     
                       "The aim is to use GLT in order to support the match officials and to install a system in all stadia, pending the successful installation, and pre-match referee tests.
                     
                       "With different technologies on the market, FIFA has launched a tender today, setting out the technical requirements for the two forthcoming competitions in Brazil."
                     
                     Fans have previously demanded that FIFA president Sepp Blatter bring in the technology after England were denied a goal in their defeat to Germany at the 2010 World Cup.
                     
                       A shot from Frank Lampard hit the underside of the crossbar and replays showed it clearly crossed the line, but Uruguayan referee Jorge Larrionda did not award a goal, which would have been an equaliser.
                    
                       Tennis and cricket at the highest level already feature the use of technology, with umpires and players able to turn to replays of key incidents for clarification.
                     
                       Blatter said at the Club World Cup that FIFA would follow suit.
