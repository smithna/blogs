LONDON: Carlos Tevez steered Manchester City into the FA Cup semi-finals with a hat-trick in a leisurely 5-0 win at home to second-tier Barnsley on Saturday.
Tevez scored three times and made two goals at the Etihad Stadium as City joined Wigan in the last four.
“I’m very pleased, because after the game, it’s easy (to beat a lower-ranked team), but before it’s never easy,” said City manager Roberto Mancini. “For this reason it’s important to have good concentration when you play this game, as the other team had nothing to lose.”
“It is important that Tevez continues to score because we need his goals between now and the end of the season, for the league and also for the cup.
“Afterwards, we don’t know what will happen in the summer. He has another year’s contract and it depends on him. At this moment we can say nothing, our focus should be on the last two months.”
Wigan shock Everton at home
In another quarter-final, Wigan shocked Everton 3-0 at Goodison Park to book a place in the semi-finals for the first time in the club’s history.
Roberto Martinez’s side are currently threatened with relegation from the Premier League, while Everton are gunning for a top-four finish, but the Latics upset the form-book with a performance as superb as it was unexpected.
“For us to go to Wembley is a unique, historic moment,” said Wigan manager Martinez.
