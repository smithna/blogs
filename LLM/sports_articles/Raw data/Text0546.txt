Every young player that comes to the Premier League finds it difficult when they first come and it is going to be the same for him. But we have already seen a lot of positive things from him.
 					 						
   		LIVERPOOL new-boy Philippe Coutinho is on course to become the Kops new samba star after an impressive full debut.
 		
  Fellow Brazilian and Lucas Leiva played alongside Coutinho in Liverpools 5-0 demolition of Swansea on Sunday.
                                                               And Lucas has nothing but praise for the way in which the 20-year-old attacking midfielder has settled in following his £8.5m January move from Inter Milan.
                                                               Coutinho scored against Swansea and Lucas said: We could see good things from him. He will be a great player.
                                                               He will need time to settle in but scoring that goal will give him confidence. He is still adapting.
                                                               Ive been talking to him about the pace of the Premier League. Even in training, he can feel it is much quicker than Italy.
                                                               Coutinho found first-team chances scarce at Inter Milan, playing just 21 senior games in three years.
                                                               He moved to Espanyol on loan this season, playing 16 times before the move to Liverpool. 
                                                              Lucas said: At Inter, he didnt get the opportunities he thought he would get. Here this is a new challenge for him.
                                                               He has settled very well and it will help him that there are a few South American players here.
                                                               But he will definitely need time. Every young player that comes to the Premier League finds it difficult when they first come and it is going to be the same for him.
                                                               But we have already seen a lot of positive things from him.
                                                               Lucas, believes the emphatic victory over Swansea will give Liverpool a lift for their Europa League second leg with Zenit St Petersburg on Thursday.
                                                               The Reds are trailing 2-0 from last weeks first leg  a result that came just three days after a shock home Premier League defeat at the hands of West Brom.
                                                              Lucas said: We started last week thinking it could be very good for us but we had the defeats against West Brom and then in the Europa League.
                                                               But we finished it well, scoring five goals and having a clean sheet. We know that we need to improve a lot.
                                                               It just gives us a bit of confidence to go into Thursday, so we can try to get through. The way we played in Zenit, we created a lot of chances.
                                                               If we can take those chances, we will have an opportunity.
