Arnaldo Tirone told ESPN Radio that the deal was ''50 to 60 per cent'' completed. He said they have agreed to financial terms with Riquelme, although he gave no details.
  	Tirone said only smaller details of the contract remain to be worked out.
  	Tirone said he had not spoken with Riquelme's former club Boca, but that he believes Riquelme is free to play in Brazil for the Sao Paulo-based team that last month was relegated to the second division.
  	Calls to Palmeiras' headquarters rang unanswered after hours Friday.
  	Riquelme left Boca last year after losing the final of the Copa Libertadores to Brazilian club Corinthians.
