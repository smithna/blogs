Wild card entrants Jarmila Gajdosova and Matthew Ebden combined to win the Australian Open mixed doubles title with a 6-3, 7-5 win over Lucie Hradecka and Frantisek Cermak on Sunday.

The Australian pair ousted second-seeded Elena Vesnina and Leander Paes in the second round and fifth-seeded Nadia Petrova and Mahesh Bhupathi in the quarterfinals.

They had two service breaks in each set and dropped twice in the match.
"As Australians it's incredible to play here," Ebden said. "We've had an incredible time the last couple of weeks and we'll see you next year."
