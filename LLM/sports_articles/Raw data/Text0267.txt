(CNN) -- Williams unveiled its new car for the 2013 season on the first day of testing at Barcelona Tuesday with renewed ambition following a complete transformation of last season's vehicle.
 The Renault-powered FW35 "is an evolution of the FW34 of 2012, it's better and more refined, with more than 80 percent new parts," Williams' technical director Mike Coughlan told reporters.
 Venezuela's Pastor Maldonado gave the team its first win in seven-and-a-half years when he triumphed at last season's Spanish Grand Prix.
 Maldonado, who is entering his third season with Williams, will be joined in the paddock by 23-year-old Finn Valtteri Bottas, who replaced Bruno Senna.

 Rosberg told the Mercedes website: "We had a mixed day today with some laps lost this morning. However we were able to work through a good program this afternoon and, of course, it's always nice to be quickest at the end of the day.
 "In general, I feel happy and comfortable in the car and it feels better than the last time we were here at this track. There is still some work to be done on tire degradation and our program this afternoon was helpful in understanding that."
