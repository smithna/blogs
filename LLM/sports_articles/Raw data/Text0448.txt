While Stuart Lancaster’s England has enjoyed wins against Scotland and Ireland and sit unbeaten at the top of the Championship table, France have lost in Italy and also at home to Wales last time out.            But Brown has warned his England team-mates that on their day France are capable of beating the best sides in the world and to beware of a wounded animal at Twickenham on Saturday.
            “They haven’t had the best start to the competition, but if you look at them in the autumn, they played some brilliant teams and came out winners,” said Brown.
            “They beat Australia, who we lost to. We know on their day they’re a dangerous, dangerous team.
            “A wounded animal’s always dangerous, so we know it’s going to be a massive test, but one we’re looking forward to.
            "If we can put our game on the pitch, we can try and carry on from the last two performances.”
            Brown has impressed in England’s two opening wins, in particular showing a great deal of confidence under the high ball; he also leads the statistics in line breaks, metres gained and defenders beaten (jointly with Ben Morgan).
            “I think I’ve been going reasonably well,” he said. “There’s still room for improvement, but I’ve been doing my job in the team well.
            "My stats for carrying are looking good. So it’s been going well. I’m learning so much from the coaches here, so I’m just trying to play my game and make sure I can have an impact on the game wherever possible.
            "I’ve had to learn a few things, getting involved as much as possible, a bit like what Chris Ashton does on the other wing.”
