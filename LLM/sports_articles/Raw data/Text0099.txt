Dallas Cowboys nose tackle Josh Brent was driving at least 110 miles per hour at the time of the crash that killed teammate Jerry Brown Jr., according to police documents obtained by NBC affiliate KXAS/NBC 5.
The documents show Brent was speeding at a minimum of 110 mph and could have sped up to 134 mph during certain points while driving home from a nightclub on Dec. 7 of last year.
Brent was charged with intoxication manslaughter. His blood alcohol content was more than twice the legal limit at the time of the crash, according to police.
Three surveillance cameras caught Brent's car driving down State Highway 114, according to the documents. Minutes later, a call was made to 911 automatically from the car's phone system.
An investigation determined that Brent's car flipped over after he hit a curb and lost control.
Brent, 25, has been placed on a reserve/non-football illness list by the Cowboys. According to the report by NBC, his case could go to trial as early as this summer, his attorney said.
