 		 	Scott Pioli is out as general manager of the Kansas City Chiefs after four years.
  	
  	The NFL club had already dismissed coach Romeo Crennel earlier this week following a 2-14 season, and Chiefs chairman Clark Hunt said then additional changes could be made.
  	''I truly apologize for not getting the job done,'' Pioli said. ''The bottom line is that I did not accomplish all of what I set out to do. To the Hunt family - to the great fans of the Kansas City Chiefs - to the players, all employees and alumni, I truly apologize for not getting the job done''
  	Pioli was hired from the New England Patriots in January 2009 and quickly fired coach Herm Edwards.
  	Pioli turned to Arizona Cardinals offensive coordinator Todd Haley as head coach and made his first major player move that offseason by acquiring quarterback Matt Cassel from the Patriots following his strong performance in place of the injured Tom Brady.
  	In 2010, the Chiefs won their first AFC West title since 2003. But a poor start the following season cost Haley his job late in 2011, with Crennel promoted from defensive coordinator.
  	''After several productive conversations, we made the difficult decision to part ways with Scott Pioli and allow him to pursue other opportunities,'' Hunt said in a statement Friday.
  	''This was a difficult decision for Scott as well,'' Hunt said. ''He has a great deal of appreciation for the history of this franchise, for our players, coaches and employees, and especially our great fans.''
  	Since the firing, the Chiefs have come to an agreement with former Eagles head coach Andy Reid.
  	Kansas City will have the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, and with five players voted to the Pro Bowl, there are certainly pieces in place for the Chiefs to make rapid improvement.
