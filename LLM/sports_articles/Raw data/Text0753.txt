That is the wrong information and I work for 16 years in England and I think I deserve a bit more credit than wrong information that has only one intention: to harm
 					 						
   		ARSENE WENGER let slip that he is feeling the heat following Arsenal's latest demoralising defeat.
 		
  The Gunners crashed out of the FA Cup to Championship side Blackburn on Saturday, increasing the chances they will extend their trophyless run.
                                                               It is nearly eight years since Arsenal last won silverware, with their hopes resting on the Champions League for this season.
                                                               Despite the lean spell, reports over the weekend suggested Wenger has opened talks on extending his stay at the Emirates beyond 2014.
                                                               But Wenger today hit out at such rumours, denying he has begun to discuss a new deal.
                                                               At a prickly press conference before tomorrow night's Champions League last-16 clash with Bayern Munich, Wenger let loose.
                                                               "That is the wrong information and I work for 16 years in England and I think I deserve a bit more credit than wrong information that has only one intention: to harm," he said.
                                                               "If it is good information which comes from nowhere it is all right, but this is wrong information that comes from nowhere and it is completely wrong."
                                                               Wenger also became involved in a heated one-on-one with a journalist.
                                                              "I look at you not because you give information, I do not know if it is you, I do not know where the information comes from. Why do you look at me? I just thought you had given this information out.
                                                               "Here this is a pre-match conference for the Champions League, if you want to talk about Saturday, that press conference has been made after the game.
                                                               "Can we get some questions about tomorrow's game, that would be very nice."
                                                               Wenger later stated he had full confidence in his players to bounce back against Bayern, highlighting his side's experience of playing in the latter stages of the Champions League.
                                                               "We know well what is going on here. What is important is to forget what people say and focus on our strengths," he said.
                                                               "We play for Arsenal in the last 16 of the Champions league, we have qualified for a long, long time.
                                                               "What is important is not what people say, it is what happens on the pitch."
