   	The country's Audit Court says the current $13.28 billion price tag for the tournament, which will bring matches to 12 Brazilian cities, is up nearly 15 percent from the initial estimate of $11.58 billion.
  	In a statement, the court said the overrun was due to the higher-than-expected cost of airport renovations and stadium construction.
  	The statement noted that while work on stadiums is progressing at a ''satisfactory'' rate, work on airports is ''moving at a slow pace.''
  	Earlier this year, the Brazilian government clashed with FIFA about the slow pace of preparations for the tournament.
