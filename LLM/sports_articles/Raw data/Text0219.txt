Neilson will tonight be assisted by Carl Emberson, Stuart Cash and the rest of the coaching staff as the hunt for a new manager begins in earnest after the game.
A statement on the club website said: “We would like to thank Paul for all he has done at LTFC
“It is with much regret we announce, by mutual consent, and as a result of genuine personal circumstances unrelated to his tenure as manager of Luton Town Football Club, Paul Buckle has, with immediate effect, parted company with the football club. 
“The reasons for Paul’s departure are fully understood by the Board, who sincerely regret that he is leaving.
“We are fully aware that achieving managerial stability will create the conditions necessary for success on the football pitch. 
“We are grateful to Paul for what he has brought to the club and believe that he has built the foundations necessary for Luton Town to achieve the Board’s desire of returning to the Football League as soon as possible. 
“A further statement will be made tomorrow morning. In the meantime, we are concentrating our efforts on tonight’s game.”
