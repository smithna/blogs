   		DAVID BENTLEY insists he can put all  the jokes behind him to revive his career.
 		
  The midfielder joined Blackburn last Friday on a three-month loan as he tries to put his Tottenham hell behind him.
                                                               Bentley, 28, joined Spurs from Rovers in 2008 in a £15m deal.
                                                               But it has all gone downhill since and his deal expires at the end of the season.
                                                               So he is desperate to start at Hull tonight after making his debut as a sub in the 1-0 FA  Cup win at Arsenal.
                                                               He said: "It was all young people enjoying yourself and that is frowned upon. In the main Im always fully fit and always was.
                                                               I want to play and be successful. I want to make changes."
                                                               Bentley forced his way out of Ewood Park but regrets ditching the club.
                                                               He added: 
															   "I was trying to be ambitious and I was wrong. It did not work out. It was a great place to work here.
                                                               Im confident in my ability but getting out on the pitch was the problem. Its about me performing for the fans. If I do that, they will like me."
