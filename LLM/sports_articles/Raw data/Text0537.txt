As the only driver to ever win the Daytona 500, the Indianapolis 500 and the Formula 1 World Driving Championship, Andretti knows all about putting on great performances on big stages.
 That’s why the trophy for the SPEED Performer of the Year award carries Andretti’s name. And it’s why Andretti wholeheartedly endorses Sebastian Vettel as this year’s recipient. 
 Vettel, 25, a native of Germany in 2012, became only the third man in the 63-year history of Formula One to win three consecutive driving championships. 
 “I think it’s particularly significant since it’s happened at such a young age,” Andretti said of Vettel’s three straight titles. “After he won the first championship, he proved (himself) over and over by winning another one and now, with a third one, it’s so solid that you cannot doubt this man’s special, special skills and talent. It’s absolutely impressive in every way.”
 Andretti cited Vettel’s resolve after falling to fourth in points after the Grand Prix of Italy, then winning the next four consecutive races to reassert control of the championship.
 “To me, that’s the mark of a real, real champion,” said Andretti. “He (Vettel) doesn’t give up. He doesn’t look sat the numbers. As long as it’s mathematically possible, he’s going to be in there.”
 Vettel was selected as the SPEED Performer of the Year from a very deep and talented field that included Ryan Hunter-Reay, Brad Keselowski and Kyle Larson, among others. 
 “Anyone — especially the top five (drivers) — could have been the recipient of this trophy with no doubt, and nobody could have argued,” said Andretti. It was that close.”
 As for the SPEED Performer of the Year award being the Mario Andretti Trophy, Andretti said, “Obviously, it’s flattering. It’s the ultimate in flattery. To have something that can be so valuable for someone’s career and to have your name on it representing that … I don’t think it gets any better than that. It’s like being inducted into the Hall of Fame.”
