The Super Bowl is usually a time of great emotions, excitement, anger, joy, and sadness. A time of great feasts and beer drinking across the United States. Perhaps the largest and oldest staple of the Super Bowl is the Chicken Wing. This great American past time and celebration of the majestic chicken wing has now been slaughtered and left behind, all thanks to two men.
 Dewayne Patterson and Renaldo Jackson are the two men who you can thank for higher wing prices and/or a shortage of the tasty chicken wing. These two stellar citizens used a rental truck to steal $65,000 worth of wings, one more time
 SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF CHICKEN WINGS.
 These two wing-nappers used a forklift to relocate 10 pallets worth of chicken wings into a rental truck in Lawrenceville, GA from a cold storage facility. For their attempt at becoming the Chicken Wing Czars they each were awarded Felony Theft charges and we were left with the loss of $65,000 worth of wings (the wings were sadly not recovered). It’s a pretty sad day that will change the way this country partakes in the Super Bowl festivities. Minus this great theft, wings have already seen an increase in price due to high demand and the cost of chicken feed rising. Now another blow to the wing fans wallets and appetites.
 Seriously though, what the hell happened to $65,000 worth of wings? Apparently smaller non-franchise wing restaurants are having to hunt around to find wings right now because of shortages and large franchises having secured amounts. So did these two steal all those wings for the chicken wing black market? I wonder if that is the new underground sensation. I certainly hope they didn’t eat all those wings. Man that is a lot of wings, I suggest using the pre-order technique to ensure a wing filled Super Bowl.
 Seriously, What The Fuck wing thieves?
