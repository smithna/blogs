Jones joined United from Blackburn Rovers in 2011 and has shown his versatility by playing at centre-half, right-back and in a central midfield role for the Premier League leaders.

The 20-year-old impressed in midfield against Tottenham Hotspur last weekend and Ferguson is delighted with the England international's progress at Old Trafford.

"Jones was absolutely brilliant at Tottenham in the role we asked him to play," said Ferguson.

"He did it really well. He can play anywhere. He is quick, two-sided and reads the game well. He's competitive and has got a great change of pace going forward so the boy has done very well."

Comparisons were drawn with Terry earlier in Jones' career, but Ferguson feels the youngster has more to his game than the Chelsea defender.

The United boss added: "Well, I think he's got more in his locker than Terry had to be honest with you but Terry gathered experience and became a fantastic central figure for Chelsea.

"Obviously, he was the main man at Chelsea but, as a young player, I think John would be the first to admit he didn't have the pace of Jones.

"He's a very versatile boy while John is a centre-back. Jones is proving himself everywhere."
