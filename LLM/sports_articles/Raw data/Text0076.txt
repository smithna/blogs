ANTHONY STOKES has vowed there will be no pause in Celtics title stampede.
 		
  The Hoops striker roared out his message after nabbing  a brace in the 6-2 win over Dundee United at Parkhead on Saturday.
                                                               Celtics sixth successive league win opened an 18-point gap on second placed Motherwell and they take on St Johnstone tomorrow as virtual title certainties.
                                                               Yet Stokes insisted the Celtic players will take nothing for granted.
                                                               He said: "We wont be taking our foot off the pedal. Its nice to wrap it up early but even if we do, we will be expected to win every game anyway. 
                                                               We demand it from ourselves to perform in each game and nothing will change our approach."
                                                               Midﬁ elder Kris Commons also hit a double, one from the penalty spot, and there were goals for defender Efe Ambrose and midﬁ elder Joe Ledley as Celtic bounced back from Champions League defeat by Juventus.
