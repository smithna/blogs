   	Although Bowyer promised to bring his redneck ways for his debut at the Rolex 24 at Daytona, ultimately, the Emporia, Kan. native decided to leave his cowboy boots in the motorcoach during his first stint for AF Waltrip Racing.
  	And it didn’t take the Rolex rookie long to learn a valuable lesson when he entered the pits in the No. 56-GT.
  	“I guess I hit the kill button or something getting in and obviously couldn’t get going so we lost a lot of track position there,” said Bowyer, who dropped to 26th in the process. “I’m super bummed out about that. The biggest thing is just getting used to the car and getting to know the car. Man, it’s hard to be consistent out there. You can’t ever get a clean lap, and then about the time you do, you’ll go in the chicane, and there’ll be dirt everywhere — you kind of revisit your dirt-track experience — and then you’re back to dodging . . . there’s some debris out there. I think there’s trunk lids — nothing too big. There’s stuff everywhere, to be honest with you.
  	“Thank God we have spotters out there. We were here to test and didn’t have any spotters. They’re lifesavers, with the DP cars coming on. That’s my biggest worry being here, just staying out of the way and not ruining one of those DP car’s day, especially costing them a good finish.”
  	Bowyer took over for his teammate Rui Aguas two hours and 19 minutes into the race. He was impressed with the Portuguese driver, who competes for AF Waltrip in the FIA World Endurance Championship tour along with Michael Waltrip Racing co-owners Waltrip and Rob Kaufmann.
  	“He did a great job early,” Bowyer said of Aguas after his 90-minute turn. “He was super fast in the car, drove up through the field. It was neat to watch that, and, unfortunately, I put us back to 12th or something and just kind of maintained there.
