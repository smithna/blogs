   	A source told FOXSports.com that Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid has hired Andy Heck as his new offensive line coach.
  	Heck, 46, was Jacksonville’s offensive line coach the past seven seasons. He was allowed to leave the Jaguars after Mike Mularkey was fired last week as head coach.
  	The Jaguars enjoyed the three most prolific rushing seasons in franchise history (2006, 2007 and 2010) behind Heck’s offensive line. Maurice Jones-Drew won the NFL’s rushing title in 2011 with a 1,606-yard campaign.
  	A 1989 first-round pick by the Seattle Seahawks, Heck was an NFL tackle for 12 seasons. He also played for the Chicago Bears (1994-98) and Washington Redskins (1999-2000). Heck broke into coaching in 2001 at the University of Virginia.
  	Reid initially appeared set to hire George Warhop as his offensive line coach. Warhop, though, decided to remain with the Cleveland Browns.

   	Reid had only two offensive line coaches during his 14-year head coaching tenure with the Philadelphia Eagles — Juan Castillo and Howard Mudd. Castillo shifted to defensive coordinator in 2011 and was fired by Reid midway through last season. Mudd retired following a 4-12 record in 2012 that led to Reid being fired.
  	Reid was then hired days later by the Chiefs, who had fired head coach Romeo Crennel.
  	The offensive line was a major Chiefs’ weakness in 2012 as Kansas City (2-14) finished with the NFL’s worst record. But by landing the No. 1 overall pick in April’s draft, Heck may get the chance to work with a blue-chip offensive lineman. Texas A&M left tackle Luke Joeckel is regarded as the top offensive-line prospect and the potential top selection.
  	The most recent left tackle to get selected at No. 1 was Miami’s Jake Long in 2008.
