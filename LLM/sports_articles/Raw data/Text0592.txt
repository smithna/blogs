With the NBA trade deadline passing at 3 p.m. ET on Thursday, here are the deals that went down.
  	
  	The Wizards sent Crawford, who has led the team in scoring 17 times this season, to Boston Celtics for center Jason Collins and injured guard Leandro Barbosa at Thursday's trade deadline.
  	The move reunites twin brothers Marcus and Markieff Morris in Phoenix, and Marcus was swapped for Robinson, his former teammate at Kansas. Houston also sent Patterson, Toney Douglas and Cole Aldrich (another college teammate of Morris) to Sacramento.
  	
   	The Hawks did not trade forward Josh Smith, the focal point of many rumors leading up to the deadline, but the did make one move, sending guard Anthony Morrow to the Dallas Mavericks for guard-forward Dahntay Jones.
  	Atlanta acquired Morrow from Brooklyn in the big offseason trade that sent Joe Johnson to the Nets. Morrow, slowed by right hip and back injuries, averaged 5.2 points in only 24 games with the Hawks. Jones, in his 10th season, has averaged 3.5 points in 50 games, including 15 starts. His contract expires at the end of the season.
 	The Heat traded center Dexter Pittman and a second-round pick and an undisclosed amount of cash to Memphis for the rights to forward Ricky Sanchez, leaving them with 14 players on guaranteed contracts. For a possible 15th spot, Greg Odenâ€™s agent said his client remains a possibility.
  	
  	A person familiar with the decision says the Golden State Warriors have agreed to separate trades that will send Jeremy Tyler to Atlanta and Charles Jenkins to Philadelphia. The salary-shedding deals allow Golden State to get under the luxury tax. Both players were drafted in the second round by the Warriors in 2011 and have played sparingly this season.
  	The Oklahoma City Thunder unloaded free-agent-to-be Eric Maynor in a trade deadline deal with Portland on Thursday, picking up a trade exception and the rights to Greek forward Georgios Printezis.
  	The Phoenix Suns have traded point guard Sebastian Telfair to the Toronto Raptors for center Hamed Haddadi and a 2014 second-round draft pick.
