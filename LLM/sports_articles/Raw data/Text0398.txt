Up front: Graham Rowntree has challenged England’s forwards (Picture: Getty)England forwards coach Graham Rowntree has braced his troops for a ferocious onslaught by the French pack at Twickenham on Saturday.
 Les Bleus head to south-west London under huge pressure after losing their opening two games of the championship for the first time since 1982.
 And Rowntree has placed his warriors on high alert for a big backlash. ‘It will change the whole complexion of their Six Nations if they win at the weekend,’ he said. ‘And the way they will challenge us is through their forward pack.
 ‘There is never a weak French scrum – that area of the game is something we always respect with France.’
 Head coach Stuart Lancaster last night named an unchanged 23-man squad for the match. Wasps number eight Billy Vunipola was pressing for selection until he suffered an ankle injury in training. As a result, Lancaster will select his starting XV from the same matchday 23 that defeated Ireland 12-6 in Dublin to stay top of the table.

 Meanwhile, France coach Philippe Saint-Andre is treating the clash as France’s ‘Grand Slam’ match.
 Defeats to Italy and Wales have left the pre-tournament favourites in a state of disarray.
 But Saint-Andre said: ‘England can be our Grand Slam. They’re in a state of euphoria. Everybody sees them winning the Grand Slam, everybody sees us taking the wooden spoon.
 ‘But we will not beat England by doing nothing. Going to Twickenham is a fantastic challenge.’
