Fulham has signed Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong on loan until the end of the season.

Frimpong made his Premier League debut for Arsenal in 2011 but was later sent on loan to Wolverhampton Wanderers last season, a stint that was cut short after he tore knee ligaments and needed surgery.

The 21-year-old midfielder was then sent on loan to Charlton last year.
