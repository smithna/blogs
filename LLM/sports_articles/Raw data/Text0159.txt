An Atlanta Falcons fan was stabbed in the neck by a 49ers fan in the Georgia Dome parking lot shortly after Sunday's NFC Championship Game, multiple outlets are reporting.
  	According to FOX 5 News in Atlanta, witnesses said a man rooting for the Falcons became involved in a verbal confrontation with a man and two women cheering for the 49ers following San Francisco's 28-24 win in Atlanta when the argument became violent and the male 49ers fan stabbed the Falcons fan in the neck.
  	Georgia Dome spokesman Jason Kirksey emailed a statement to The Associated Press confirming an altercation occurred in a parking lot outside the dome at 6:40 p.m. and that a 35-year-old fan was taken to nearby Grady Hospital and in stable condition.
  	The statement said it is unclear ''if anyone involved in the altercation attended the game'' and that Georgia Dome and Atlanta police ''are investigating the incident.''
