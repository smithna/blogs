The New York Liberty have re-signed veteran forward-center Kara Braxton.

Selected No. 7 overall by Detroit in the 2005 WNBA Draft, the former Georgia star has averaged 7.5 points, 4.5 rebounds and 47-percent shooting from the field in eight seasons with the Shock, Phoenix and New York.

The Liberty acquired the 6-foot-6 Braxton from the Mercury in Aug. 2011 and she has averaged 5.8 points and 4.1 rebounds in 47 games with New York.

Braxton was on Detroit's championship teams in 2006 and 2008 with Plenette Pierson, and two are joined in New York this season by former teammate Katie Smith and coach Bill Laimbeer. The Liberty also acquired the rights to former Shock star Deanna Nolan last week.

Terms of the deal announced Monday were not disclosed.
