The Detroit Lions are in need of a big-play running back (again), and Reggie Bush would appear to fit the bill.

Bush averaged 1,036 yards rushing and 1,356 total yards over the past two seasons in Miami. He’s about to hit the free-agent market in March, and Lions wide receiver Nate Burleson, for one, is going to do whatever he can to convince Bush to come to the Motor City.

Burleson joined Pittsburgh’s Ryan Clark as guest analysts on the NFL Network’s “NFL AM” Monday, and tabbed Bush as the one free agent he most wants on the Lions.

“You already took your talents to South Beach. Come on to Detroit,” Burleson said, addressing Bush directly through the camera. “I know it’s not as sunny and it may not be the same type of glitz and glamour, but you can do wonders for us.

“We lost Jahvid Best, he was the speed guy, the complement guy to a guy like Mikel Leshoure. Reggie Bush has proven that he’s still explosive. Everybody knows he can shake a little bit … break off that big run.

“If I can get Reggie Bush in a Detroit Lions uniform … oooh, watch out.”

While the soon-to-be 28-year-old Bush may fit Detroit’s scheme, his price tag could push him out of the Lions’ range.

Even with some recent roster moves (cutting Kyle Vanden Bosch and Stephen Peterman and reworking Dominic Raiola’s contract), Detroit does not have much wiggle room under the salary cap — they entered the offseason with about $3 million to spend and have bumped that number into double figures. Still, they have a boatload of their own free agents, including DE Cliff Avril.

That said, Bush would solve a lot of Detroit’s backfield problems, especially with Leshoure showing some flashes of brilliance last year.

Will Burleson’s recruiting pitch help?
