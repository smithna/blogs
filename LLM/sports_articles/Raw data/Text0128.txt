   		LEWIS HAMILTON gave his new Mercedes a cautious thumbs-up after finally ­getting in a decent test ­session at Jerez yesterday.
 		
The Brit racers new team had been plagued by problems on the opening two days in Spain.
                    
                     First Nico Rosbergs car caught fire because of an electrical fault, then  Hamiltons brakes failed at 170pmh and he slammed into a tyre barrier.
                     
                     But on the final day he completed 145 laps, equal to two grands prix.
                     
                     He ended up sixth fastest behind ­Lotus driver Kimi Raikkonen, with Ferraris Felipe Massa posting the fastest time over the four days.
                     
                     Hamilton said: "We have some work to do but it doesnt feel like a disaster."
                     
                     Mercedes ended last season ­struggling even to score points, while ­Hamiltons former team McLaren had Formula 1s fastest car. But he said: It seems were not in a bad starting place, so it must be a big improvement.
                     
                     I feel like its a good platform, a good foundation to work on. Im just going to keep on asking for more downforce and hope the guys continue to do a great job back at the factory
                    
                     Its been good to get some laps in. Its great to get a feeling for the car.
                     
                     Its still very early in terms of ­understanding what he wants and of course were at one circuit for one day.
                     
                     Hes clearly a person who enjoys ­being involved at all levels and thats a great motivation for the team.
                     
                     Hes been working hard with the ­engineers this test. Hes been here on the days when Nicos been driving with a headset on, ­listening to whats going on.
                     
                     "We know what happened last year, we know what we need to do this year."
                    
                     "We need to quietly get on with it, not panic and make sure we do things in the right way. We have two great drivers to help us do that."
