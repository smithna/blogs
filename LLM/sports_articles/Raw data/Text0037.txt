Jenkins, who left Cardiff at the end of last season to join Toulon, will link up with fellow British and Irish Lions front-rower Matthew Rees after the hooker also signed for the capital region.
 And Blues director of rugby Phil Davies admits he is delighted to have the player back to add some experience to a young squad.
"Gethin's experience will add to the team, he is very vocal on the pitch and I am sure that a lot of the youngsters will also be very vocal with him as well next year." 			
 "I am really pleased to have re-signed Gethin," Davies said. "We started the year knowing we had a young squad and it has been a massive season of progression, sometimes the results have not gone our way."
"Gethin will be coming back to an environment that is a little different from the one he left and I think, hopefully, he will enjoy it and I know that he will add a massive amount to the group."
 "Gethin's experience will add to the team, he is very vocal on the pitch and I am sure that a lot of the youngsters will also be very vocal with him as well next year."
 "The experience of Gethin, Matthew Rees along with the likes of Gavin Evans and Dafydd Hewitt who are really experienced players will help."
 "Hopefully with the youthful exuberance of the young players combined with the experienced players will be an excellent mix for us next year. Gethin is an international player, a Lion and a quality player."
 "I am delighted that he has come back, it is a fantastic signing for us. It is great to be able to bring a senior Wales player back."
