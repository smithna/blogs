The pressure is on to make sure we start better. Last year we underperformed, certainly until the  European season.
 					 						
   		PAUL di RESTA is confident Force India can start the new Formula One season on a stronger footing than 12 months ago.
 		
The team are looking to build on last seasons  seventh-place finish in the constructors championship.
                                          The Silverstone-based team know a strong start is vital if they are to  move up the order after several seasons battling in the middle of the pack.
                                          Asked if Force India could kick on, Di Resta said: Theres no reason why we shouldnt.
                                          The pressure is on to make sure we start better. Last year we underperformed, certainly until the  European season.
                                          We need to launch a car, understand it, and  bring a race package to it that makes the car quicker than when it was rolled out.
                                          Force India say the VJM06 is a totally new car and the 26-year-old Scot is confi dent about finally landing a maiden F1 podium. Last years fourth in Singapore is Di Restas best result in his 39 races to date.
                                          Were all trying to do the best job possible. When it all gels well we can obviously see the results we get, he said.
                                          Di Resta still does not know who his team-mate will be this season after Nico Hulkenberg left to join Sauber.
