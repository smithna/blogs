 		 	The New York Mets, landing their first major-league free agent this off-season, have reached agreement with right-hander Shaun Marcum, according to a major-league source.
  	
 	Where did 2012's top free agents land and who's still available?
 
   	It's a one-year deal, and Marcum still must take a physical.
  	Marcum, 31, likely will be the team’s fifth starter, joining left-handers Johan Santana and Jon Niese and righties Dillon Gee and Matt Harvey.
  	When healthy, Marcum is one of the game’s more effective pitchers. He averaged 198 innings in 2010 and ’11, but missed two months last season with right elbow tightness.
  	News of the deal was first reported by Jon Heyman of CBSSports.com.
