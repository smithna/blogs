Jockey Ramon Dominguez has made enough progress in the recovery from a fractured skull that he was transferred out of intensive care.
  	Dominguez was injured when his mount Convocation stumbled and fell in a race Jan. 18 at Aqueduct, pitching the rider onto the winterized inner track.
  	
   	He was moved on Thursday from the neurological ICU at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center to a medical step-down unit, an intermediate location between the ICU and a regular inpatient room.
  	''Ramon's doctors say he is recovering well, and we're beginning to discuss his rehab options,'' wife Sharon said in a statement.
  	There are no target dates for when Dominguez will be released from the hospital, nor a career-resumption timetable for the three-time defending Eclipse Award winner as the nation's leading jockey.
  	Dominguez set the North American record last year when his mounts earned $25.5 million.
