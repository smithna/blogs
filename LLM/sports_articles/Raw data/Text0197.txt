American Michael Thompson won his first PGA Tour title at the Honda Classic after Englishman Lee Westwood fell away in the final round.
Thompson, 28, shared the lead with Luke Guthrie going into Sunday but a round of one under par was enough to secure victory in Florida.
Westwood started the day two shots off the lead but had to settle for a share of ninth after shooting four over par.
Englishman David Lynn tied for fourth after a one-under-par round of 69.
Thompson was one of only three players to break par in difficult conditions on the final day at Palm Beach Gardens.
After a bogey on the 16th, Thompson led by just one shot from Geoff Ogilvy heading down the 18th but picked up a birdie to win by two.
Hoping for a third PGA title, Westwood recorded a birdie on the third.
But he bogeyed the fifth and six holes before dropping a further three shots on the back nine to finish well back.
