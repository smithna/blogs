Chris Perez suffered a shoulder injury that will sideline him from throwing for the next 7-10 days and from pitching in spring training games for the next 3-4 weeks.  While this injury may not impact his fantasy value for the majority of the season, it is worth noting the guys behind the Tribe's closer.
  First up on the list is Vinnie Pestano who racked up 59 holds in the setup role over the last two seasons.  However, John Halpin was quick to point out that Pestano struggles against lefties (Stats: Pestano .780 career OPS v. LH, .446 v. RH. Also 43 K in 62 IP vs. LH, 125 K/ 75 IP vs. RH) and may be skipped over in favor of ...
  Joe Smith.  The side-armed slinger's lefty/righty splits are balanced. He limited righties to .230 AVG and .296 OBP and lefties to a .189 BA and .269 OBP with 21 holds and an ERA under 3.00 and 1.16 WHIP in 2012.
  Perez says he'll address the injury tomorrow.
