The Indiana Fever have signed Shyra Ely and Jessica Breland to their training camp roster.

Ely is a 6-foot-2 forward who was a backup for the Fever during their run to the WNBA title. She played at Tennessee, but grew up in Indianapolis, attended Ben Davis High School and was Indiana's Miss Basketball in 2001.

Breland is a 6-3 forward from North Carolina. She was Minnesota's first-round draft pick in 2011, No. 13 overall. She spent the 2011 season with New York and Connecticut and was cut by Washington in training camp last year. Breland has been playing in Turkey this winter and is a teammate of Fever point guard Briann January.
