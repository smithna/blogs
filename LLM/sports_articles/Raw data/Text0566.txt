When Arsenal take on Bayern Munich on Tuesday night they will be greeted by a strange sight – Manuel Neuer wearing a four-fingered glove (or three fingered with a thumb if you want to be pedantic).
 The Germany international goalkeeper had the glove – on his right hand only – especially designed by Adidas after bruising his hand in training.
 Rather than sitting out any matches, the new glove connects his index and middle finger together in one place, thus limiting pain and stabilising the sensitive area sufficiently enough to allow him continue to play.
 Neuer tested the glove out for the first time this weekend and he seemed to be alert as ever as he kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 win at Wolfsburg.
 The 26-year-old has established himself as arguably the best goalkeeper in the world and is in simply sensational form for Bayern this season.
 The German giants have yet to concede a goal in 2013 and have only let in seven goals all season in the Bundesliga.
 Arsenal will be hoping home advantage will give them the edge in the first leg at the Emirates but amazingly Neuer has conceded just one goal away from home in the Bundesliga this season in 11 matches.
 Finger missing or not, Arsenal will have their work cut out beating the former Schalke man on Tuesday night.
