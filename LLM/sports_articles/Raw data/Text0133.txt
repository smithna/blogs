The January transfer window generally passes by with negligible notice by Sir Alex Ferguson. In fact, the last major business I remember being done in January (could be wrong here) was the signing of Evra and Vidic in 2006. Both of them became first team regulars, but it took them a while to settle in. That has always been Sir Alex’s main aversion to signing mid-season; even if you get a good player, they don’t have any integration period so it can put the team out of joint. Fair enough. But the transfer that has been announced today will not fall into that category. Wilfred Zaha will join United, but not until July 2013.
 This transfer has been in the gossip pages for most of the transfer window, but I stopped placing any value on them after Ronaldinho was meant to signing way back in 2002. He’s signed, he’s here, he’s going to revolutionise the club….wait, he’s at Barcelona airport? Anyway, it seems the deal has indeed been struck, proving papers are bound to get things right in the end, if only accidently. It was also made clear from the very start that any deal to prise Zaha away from Crystal Palace would not prise Zaha away from Crystal Palace. That is, an agreement would be made for the signing, but he would continue to play for Palace until the rest of the season. This is the state of affairs as it stands.
 The cost seems to be £10m, rising to around £15m with bonuses for future achievement. There is no doubt that he has talent, and much potential at the age of 20. He plays in an attacking role, a winger or a striker generally. The Crystal Palace team rate him very highly, and he is already a key part of their side, prompting the request to keep him for the rest of the season as Palace try to achieve promotion. It’s a classic young-player-with-potential signing by Utd, I do question whether he is exactly the kind of player that’s required. I think it certainly spells the end of Macheda’s attempt to prove his place, the aforementioned player will be loaned to Germany’s Stuttgart for the rest of the season and I doubt will feature in any plans beyond that. 
 Many expect big things from Zaha, so let’s hope they are right. Thoughts and comments on whether Zaha is right for Utd below! Is the fee too high/too low? 
 FA Cup action tomorrow against Fulham. Match report will be up on Sunday. 
   
 				 					Welcome back Uday! I agree, I think £10m is pretty high. I like the phrase 'English tax' though and Hernandez is an excellent comparison in terms of value. Also, Sneijder, linked with Utd for some time, has just gone to Galatasaray for about £8m. Obviously, he's 28, less resale value, but prices do seem very unpredictable these days. 
 With regards to playing for England, he was named as a substitute for the Sweden match in November and came on as a late substitute. He's also named in the squad to face Brazil. He did pass up the possibility of being considered for the Ivory Coast squad for the African Cup of Nations, so that may mean he's made up his mind, unlike England who never do seem to know what's their best striker combination. However, even if he features against Brazil, and don't quote me on this but I believe it to be correct, as both of those games are friendlies, non-competitive fixtures in football law speak, he is still entitled to opt for the Ivory Coast at a later date, as he is still yet to appear in a competitive fixture. Time will tell I guess.  
 				
 				 					10 million to rise to 15 pending peformances etc.? I think this is a bit high for a guy with "potential".   I think its "English Tax", or whatever they call it. Look at Hernandez. On a tangent, has he chosen to play for England? I heard something about him being undecided. And there are pros and cons to that, I am sure. 
Sorry, been away for sometime.
