Matt Smith was once again the hero for Oldham at the weekend as his header deep into stoppage time earned Oldham a 2-2 draw with Everton in the fifth round of the FA Cup.
 However, while Smith’s goal will have earned the club a lucrative replay at Goodison Park, his goal celebration has ended up costing him a week's wages.
 The 6' 6" striker, who scored two goals in the previous round against Liverpool, sent Boundary Park into raptures by coming off the bench and heading home a corner in the fourth and last minute of injury time.
 However, in his jubilation he ignored a pre-match directive from the club that warned players about getting rid of their shirts as he threw his into the crowd.
 A sign on the dressing room before the match said: "Please be advised that due to a severe shortage of first team home shirts, players must not give away their kit following the conclusion of the Everton match."
 Smith has now been fined a week's wages of around £400 for giving his jersey away and so short are the club of shirts that they are trying to find the fan who claimed his shirt so they can ask him to return it.
 He's not the only player to get into trouble either, with a number of players reported to have swapped their shirts with players.
 Jose Baxter, who swapped his with Leighton Baines, told the Mail: "We all got carried away and didn’t really think about the notice. I just hope we've got enough kit for Tuesday."
 Meanwhile a club source told the Daily Star: "There is an automatic fine system in place for misplaced pieces of the kit.
 "In the meantime we will do what we can to get our hands on as many of the missing shirts as possible."
 Oldham are expected to earn around £500,000 from the replay.
