The 24-year-old Dallas Cowboys wide receiver has a fractured left index finger that requires surgery. But he could choose to play in Sunday's game with the aid of a splint. Bryant was seen during the media portion of Thursday's practice wearing a padded white glove that allowed the tip of his index finger to be exposed.
Cowboys tight end Jason Witten and cornerback Brandon Carr both said Thursday that Bryant looked good catching the ball during practice.
"I took some reps today," Bryant said. "I took quite a few."
Coach Jason Garrett confirmed Thursday morning that Bryant's Wednesday visit with a second hand specialist revealed "pretty similar" information to the first examination.
"We don't have a definitive plan for Dez right now," Garrett said Thursday. "He did see the doctor yesterday. Nothing really changed. We're going to see how he feels today and see if there's a chance that he can play. He went through the walkthrough yesterday. He didn't do anything in practice yesterday. Seemed like he was feeling fine. But we have to make a decision there as to what we want to do. Dez is certainly a part of that decision. The medical analysis is part of that decision as well."
The Cowboys training staff is looking into splints and taping methods that would allow Bryant to play Sunday.
"He certainly has a willingness to play," Garrett said. "He certainly has a toughness to play. We just have to see if he can function the way he needs to."
