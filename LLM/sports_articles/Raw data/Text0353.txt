Suarez was virtually unplayable as Liverpool bounced back from a week to forget by hoisting themselves into seventh place in the Premier League.
                                          The Uruguayans name appears on the score sheet just once but his performance was much more valuable than that contribution alone.
                                          He was involved in four of Liverpools goals, including his own, and caused mayhem in the Swansea rearguard throughout.
                                          No wonder he received a standing ovation from an appreciative Anﬁ eld crowd when he was hauled off after 78 minutes.
                                          He looked dejected at the decision to remove him from the action but manager Brendan Rodgers said that was a typical response from the striker.
                                          Rodgers said: "He has played nearly every minute of every game. He has been brilliant for us and I wanted him to get a round of applause.
                                          But he wanted to continue and thats the nature of the guy. He just wanted to carry on playing for every minute of the game."
                                          After a week in which Liverpool had suffered Premier League defeat by West Brom and a Europa League setback in St Petersburg, a win was essential.
                                          And they delivered the goods against Rodgerss old club as they quelled mounting frustration among their fans  at least for the time being.
                                          But they were certainly helped along by a much-changed Swansea team that was on the ropes for long periods.
                                          With one eye clearly on next Sundays Capital One Cup Final at Wembley, Swansea boss Michael Laudrup made seven changes from his last team selection.
                                          It was the kind of move that Liverpool had to take full advantage of  and thats precisely what they did.
                                          The biggest surprise was that the margin of victory wasnt greater against a team that showed little resistance.
                                          Rodgers said: "It was an important three points. We have had a bumpy road this week and had to show some commitment in this game.
                                          It was an outstanding performance and we showed plenty of character and overall I am very pleased.
                                         But Swansea boss Laudrup said frankly: It was a nightmare. We got slaughtered and it was awful.
                                          We just have to say sorry to the fans who travelled. I am responsible as I pick the team.
                                          We made changes but that is no excuse. There have been changes in the last couple of months and we have still got results. I thought we were capable of getting a result, but I am wrong. We did not compete at all and it could have been 10-0."
                                          Liverpool took the lead after Suarez had been upended in the penalty area by Kemy Agustien following a 33rd-minute Steven Gerrard corner.
                                          Gerrard, who had a penalty saved against West Brom last Monday, made no mistake this time round with a low shot to the right of keeper Michel Vorm.
                                          The goal capped an opening spell of almost complete Liverpool dominance in which Swansea had their backs right against the wall.
                                          Any hopes that the Swans may have harboured about a ﬁghtback were then dashed with three goals in the opening 12 minutes of the second half.
                                          Philippe Coutinho, making his full debut after his £8.5m January move from Inter Milan, rounded off a ﬁne move within 16 seconds of the restart.
                                          He received a great pass from Suarez before slotting the ball past Vorm.
                                          Jose Enrique then popped up with only his second goal for Liverpool after combining well in an excellent one-two with Daniel Sturridge after 50 minutes.
                                          To compound Swanseas misery, Suarez virtually strolled through their defence before riﬂing in a 57th-minute right-foot shot.
                                          Sturridge then joined in on the goalscoring act by hammering home a 71st minute penalty after Suarez had been barged in the box by sub Wayne Routledge.
                                          It really did turn out to be a day on which Liverpool had a shoot-on-sight policy with Suarez and Sturridge leading the way.
                                          The only downside for Liverpool was a suspected dislocated shoulder to sub Fabio Borini, who could be out for the rest of the season.
