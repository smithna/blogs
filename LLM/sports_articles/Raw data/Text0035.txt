Watson, seeded fourth, failed to reproduce the comeback that had got her through to the        last eight in Memphis.      
                   She looked tired after lengthy matches against        Galina Voskoboeva         and        Andrea Hlavackova         earlier in the week. 
                   Switzerland's Voegele, 48 places below world number 41 Watson in rankings, dominated from start to finish.
