The Nigerian striker wants to leave The Hawthorns before the window closes after being the subject of a failed bid from Queens Park Rangers, but saw a transfer request rejected on Friday.

He subsequently released a statement expressing his disappointment at the decision and has now fired off a second outburst on Twitter.

Odemwingie is thrilled to have captured the interest of Rangers boss Harry Redknapp and tweeted on Saturday night: "Best compliment I have ever received in my (career) as a player. manager like HR spending to bring me for mission "impossible"."

He also wrote: "Offer came, everybody knows.

"I ask club what they think ? Answer - not now. Maybe summer. I ask- or is it tactics to get more money? Answer- we have enough now there is no prise (price) for you. We need you.

"I say ok. What's the prise for summer ? We will tell you after the window closes.

"I say - I have served the club well and deserve at least to have a prise now so I can plan my probably last move in England.

"Don't want another summer window not knowing what will happen cos now I ll have to move my little son elsewhere. after all I have contributed to the clubs success last two seasons I hoped to at least get a low prise. Answer- talk later.

"Last season January window is when I should have handed in transfer request. Was one foot in Rubin Kazan - not for sale. Fulham. Not for sale. Newcastle. Not for sale. Wigan. Not for sale.

"Loyalty left 70 percent. the rest they stole out of my pocket thinking I was keeping money in there."

Odemwingie earlier on Saturday came under fire from some Albion fans after making clear his desire to leave.

He tweeted: "I can understand the reaction of few Albion fans on my desire to leave the club. Real reason? Cos they once doubted my commitment.

"Want to know why I wanted to quit top flight football last summer earlier than I wished to? They know at the club.

"Albion fans are not the only reason, but made it easier for me to decide to stay and try my best to forget about the disappointment.

"I succeeded in doing that. But it's not getting better.Before bigger disappointment comes one day, I better leave on a good note."
