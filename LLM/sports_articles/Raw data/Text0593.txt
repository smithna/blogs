PORTLAND, Ore. — After his nearly dubious triple-double — 14 points, 10 assists and nine turnovers — in a 101-90 loss to the Golden State Warriors, Bulls point guard Derrick Rose stood at his locker late Saturday night in Oakland, Calif., trying to make sense of probably his worst game of the season.
 “It was just one of those games where it wasn’t going our way,” he said. “We tried to force it. It was just one of those nights.”
 Someone asked if this was the kind of performance ‘‘where he obsessed over the stat sheet or simply threw it away?”
 “Both,” he said. “I look at it and then I threw it away. It’s actually right there.”
  Rose pointed to a spot about 10 feet from his locker where, sure enough, a crumpled-up box score rested. 
  In the grand scheme of things, there wasn’t much else for the Bulls to do after one of their worst losses of the season. It snapped a six-game winning streak and was their first double-digit loss since a 104-92 defeat at Boston on Dec. 3.
 Rose said part of the problem — and the reason for his high number of turnovers — was the trapping defense the Warriors used against the pick-and-roll plays with Rose and power forward Carlos Boozer.
 “The way they did it, they had the guy that was sticking Carlos and then they had someone right behind him coming over,” Rose said. “So if I drove baseline, he’d cut me off and the guy sticking Carlos would deny him. If I drove the middle, the guy on the side of [Boozer] would come out and double-team and someone would always be on him.
 “It was just something we haven’t seen before.”
 Coach Tom Thibodeau, though, wasn’t buying that explanation. 
  “I don’t know if the traps were successful,” Thibodeau said. “Our turnovers came from over-dribbling and dribbling into a crowd. They were collapsing on dribble penetration. When we made the simple plays and just hit the open man, that’s how we scored effectively. We scored [at a normal pace] for the first three quarters, and then we struggled to score.”
  Still, the Bulls had a 65-53 lead midway through the third quarter, but then scored just 25 points in the final 18 minutes. However, offense wasn’t the main problem.
 “We didn’t stop them,” Rose said. “They were getting everything that they wanted, and they were playing with confidence. We had a couple of chances to blow the game open. We were up by a large amount, and our defense just didn’t hold them.
 “If our offense isn’t going, we have to hold them on defense, plain and simple. Our defense is what makes us a good team. That wasn’t us ­tonight.”
 But if there’s one thing the Bulls have shown this season, it’s resiliency. They’ve dropped consecutive games only three times and usually follow losses with big performances.
  The same thing can be said of Rose. He has had few dud games this season, but has bounced back with solid performances nearly every time.
  The best example came after he had 17 points on 5-for-17 shooting with four turnovers in a loss at Charlotte on Jan. 12. In the next game, he had 29 points (11-for-22 shooting) and 10 rebounds in a win at Indiana and followed that with 34 points the next night in a win over Miami.
 After consecutive losses to Orlan-do and at Boston — games where Rose shot a combined 12-for-30 — he bounced back with 30 points and 11 assists in an overtime victory against Houston, adding a game-tying, buzzer-beating three-pointer at the end of regulation in that game for good measure.
 Rose will look to do the same tonight against the Portland Trail Blazers at the Rose Garden.
