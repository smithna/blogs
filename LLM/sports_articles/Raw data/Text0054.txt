England spinner Graeme Swann swaps a cricket bat for a golf club and uses the edge of a cliff for his crease in a trick shot which goes horribly wrong.

While playing a round of golf in New Zealand with James Anderson and cameraman Stuart Broad, Swann tries to impress his team-mates by attempting to volley a ball off a rocky height into the sea.

Using Anderson's custom-made driver to perform the speculative shot, Swann successfully smacks the ball towards deep extra cover - but also sends the head of Jimmy's club into the ocean.
