Dwain Chambers has been selected for Great Britain's European Indoor Championships squad despite an underwhelming performance on his return from injury.  
 The former European 60m champion, who won silver in Paris two years ago, has been struggling with a back problem and missed the trials in Sheffield before finishing fifth at the British Athletics Grand Prix in Birmingham.  
 The 34-year-old, who ran a season's best 6.58sec to beat Kim Collins of St Kitts & Nevis and American Mike Rodgers in Glasgow in January, admitted that he did not want to take part in March's championships in Gothenburg if he was not fully fit.   
 But he has now been included in head coach Peter Eriksson's team, which will be captained by defending 800m champion Jenny Meadows, who qualified on her return in Birmingham after 16 months on the sidelines.  
 "It's a great honour to be named captain of the GB & NI team," Meadows said.  
 "I'm really excited to be given the opportunity to follow Helen Clitheroe, who did such a brilliant job in Paris two years ago."  
 Great Britain won eight medals at the European Indoors two years ago and Eriksson is targeting a similar haul when the championships start on March 1.  
 "I have been really encouraged by the performances so far by the team in 2013, and I'm sure this will continue at the European Indoors," he said.  
 "Jenny  has shown that she is a very strong character, with great leadership qualities and experience on this stage - she will be a great captain for the GB & NI team."  
 Olympic high jump bronze Robbie Grabarz will bid to add to his European outdoors bronze medal from 2012, while pole vaulter Holly Bleasdale arrives as the world No. 1 after an impressive start to the year.  
 The 21-year-old cleared 4.75 to win in Moscow earlier this month ahead of Olympic silver medallist Yarisley Silva and 2011 World champion Fabiana Murer.  
 Christine Ohuruogu will complete a strong women's 4x400m team alongside Perri Shakes-Drayton, Eilidh Child and Shana Cox, while James Dasaolu, who claimed his first 60m title in Chambers' absence in Sheffield, and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey will carry Britain's sprint hopes.
