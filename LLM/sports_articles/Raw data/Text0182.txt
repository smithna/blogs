The Real Madrid superstar is set for a first clash with United since leaving the club for a world record  £80m in 2009.
                    
                     Ronaldo secured three Premier League titles and a Champions League gong during six years at United, having joined as a 17-year-old.
                     
                     Ferguson rates Ronaldo as one of the best  and bravest  players he has ever worked with.
                     
                     Last month, the Old Trafford boss admitted he would love to see Ronaldo in United colours once again, but described his former starlet as unbuyable.
                     
                     Even though he thinks it is unlikely that Ronaldo, whose current deal expires in 2015, will strut his stuff for United again, he hopes it will happen one day.
                     
                     He said: "Id love to see that, but its fanciful thinking ­really. First of all, how much it would take to get him from Real Madrid and secondly, I dont think theres any chance they would want to sell him. But you never know. I dont know when his contract finishes."
                     
                     He may want to go to another club at some point in his career, and Id hope he would want to come here, but thats a long way off.
                     
                     Fergie added: "The contract with Real says he cant play against us, seriously! I think it will be a disgrace if he plays against us. He has no loyalty to us!"
                     
                     United fans still sing Ronaldos name  during matches.
                     
                     And Ferguson thinks the Portuguese goal-machine deserves the reception he is ­assured on his return to Old Trafford for the Champions League clash in February.
                     
                     He revealed Ronaldo wanted to quit for the Bernabeu in 2008, but was persuaded to stay and helped guide United to his third Premier League title.
                     
                     Ferguson said: "To get six years out of a boy when he comes at 17 and played for us for six years, weve done well. 
                     
                     He always had a hankering to go to  Madrid in his career and we helped him on that way. It wasnt disloyalty because I got  another year out of him when he wanted to go the previous year and he honoured that and was fantastic for us. He went with our blessing. 
                     
                     I was sorry when he left, dont get me wrong, but equally I was honoured that he gave me that extra year. 
                     I had absolutely no problem with letting him go to Real Madrid after that."
                     
                     Fergie, whose side head to Swansea  tomorrow, claims Paul Scholes, 38, has made no decision on his future yet.
                     
                     He also said Ryan Giggs, 39, could play for another two years and  has rejected talk about defender Rio Ferdinands future.
                     
                     The United boss said: "Scholesy says very little and I would be surprised if he spoke to some pal without speaking to me, which he hasnt done. 
                     
                     Youve got to dismiss that and I think that Ryan Giggs will play for  another year or two maybe. Rios form this year has been terrific. 
                     
                     Its the kind of speculation you expect because we only put older players on one-year contracts."
                     
                     Ferguson has also tied defender Jonny Evans to a new deal until 2016.
