MINNEAPOLIS – Minnesota Lynx point guard Lindsay Whalen has left her team in Turkey over a contract dispute. The vast majority of WNBA players sign lucrative contracts overseas each winter, making a large chunk of their yearly earnings that way, and Whalen had been playing during this offseason for Galatasaray.

Whalen confirmed her exit from Galatasary on Monday via Twitter in a series of messages that read: "Thank you to my teammates and coaches for everything during my time with Galatasaray! Unfortunately because the terms of my contract were not met I felt it was in my best interest to not continue with the organization. Thank you to the fans of Galatasaray!! Your support of the team and players is amazing!"

According to a Minneapolis Star-Tribune translation of a report from Turkey's NTV Spor, Whalen had not been paid for two months. In Turkey, she was averaging 13.6 points, 5.1 rebounds and 4.4 assists in 10 EuroLeague games.

Whalen will rejoin the Lynx this spring for training camp, which will begin several weeks in advance of their June 1 season opener. She has not yet announced whether she will join another team in Europe for the end of the season and potentially the playoffs.
