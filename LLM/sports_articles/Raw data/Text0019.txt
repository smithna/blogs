His daughter, Taylor James Hamlin, was born Sunday night. While Hamlin, his girlfriend Jordan Fish and little daughter are doing fine, they are also adjusting to a new life — something that has briefly consumed Hamlin’s attention and perhaps put a championship run a little deeper in his thoughts for a few days.
  	
   	Hamlin, who says that James is his first name and a family name, said that so far being a father has been easier than expected. In fact, the toughest part seems to have been sweating out the four days extra she waited to join the family.
  	Hamlin skipped the testing of the Generation 6 car at Charlotte Motor Speedway last week as he waited for his daughter’s birth.
  	“That was the biggest thing was being four days late," Hamlin said. "It’s like, ‘OK, it’s coming in a minute. Any minute, any minute.'”
  	As to deciding to miss the test, that was an easy call — he wanted to stay by Fish’s side.
  	“I felt like it was more important not to leave her at any point,” he said.
  	He said his and Fish’s parents have been on hand to help out and that he’s not losing that much sleep yet since Taylor James is sleeping quite a bit.
