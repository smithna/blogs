It looks a mis-match on paper: the runaway Bundesliga leaders, winners of the European Cup four times, against an Arsenal side that lost 1-0 to Championship Blackburn in the FA Cup at the weekend.
 In his press conference, though, Arsene Wenger was adamant that "you cannot compare the FA Cup to the Champions League", and across two legs - the first of which comes in London on Tuesday night - Arsenal will hold some hope of springing a surprise in the last-16.
 Bayern Munich's record is daunting - they have conceded only one goal away from home in the Bundesliga this season - but anything can happen in Europe, can't it?
 We asked our offices from around the continent to give us their predictions ahead of the big game, and you can read who Europe thinks will advance to the quarter-finals – including the opinions of both the British and German Eurosport offices.
 Our European cousins also gave us their view on Wenger's current position...
 The lost final against Chelsea was the most moving experience in the history of the club. Now the players of Bayern Munich are willing to give everything to alleviate the pain. And they will succeed. The team is more compact than ever before, has matured and is definitely merciless. For Arsenal, their chances of reaching the quarter-finals are quite bad. The championship is gone, the FA Cup too.
 It seems as though Arsene Wenger is putting everything on the Champions League to bring a long-awaited title to the Gunnners. That could be wrong, and in turn could force the club to seek new ideas. Whether they will come from Wenger is doubtful.
 Over two legs Arsenal have no chance against a Bayern side who are without doubt one of the finest in Europe at the moment – and arguably in the top three. Jupp Heynckes's team haven’t conceded a single goal yet in 2013 and, most worryingly for Arsenal, have only conceded one away goal all season in the Bundesliga. Given Arsenal’s recent struggle for form I can’t see anything other than a sizeable defeat for Arsenal over two legs.
 It is a defining contest for Wenger in that it will almost certainly confirm another season without silverware, but the real damage has been done in the domestic cups with defeats to lower-league opposition against Bradford and Blackburn. On Saturday the atmosphere was as poisonous as it ever has been under Wenger and fans were openly shouting abuse at him. Another poor performance on Tuesday will probably mean more of the same – and unless something miraculous happens, Arsenal won’t be in the next round.
 Arsenal have no chance against Bayern Munich. They are too strong, too powerful for Giroud and his lads. I say it again, Arsenal will finish this season without any trophy. For sure. More than the difference in quality between the two sides, I think it is the style of play of Bayern that will hurt the Gunners.
 Concerning Wenger, it seems if I have read the English press correctly that he still has a future in London, with plenty of money to spend next summer. That is good for him and for Arsenal but, more than the more money, I have big doubts concerning the targets of the manager. Jovetic and others are good players but you don't win the Premier League with them.
 In the Champions League all options are possible, but the chances of Arsenal getting past Bayern Munich don't seem brilliant. Why? Because this Arsenal side is definitely not one of the best 20 in Europe at present. Nowadays, Bayern is not only a runner-up, they are one of the best teams in the world and runaway leaders of the Bundesliga. There is not much of a chance for Arsenal without a leader on the pitch and the fading passion of Arsene Wenger is not enough.
 WINNER: Bayern Munich
 Bayern are playing really well at the moment: five wins in a row and no goals conceded in 2013, so they’re surely favourites to progress to the last eight. But they shouldn't be overconfident: even if the 'clean-sheet-mantra' is working fine at the moment, the Bavarians weren’t that brilliant in their last two away games against Mainz and Wolfsburg and they’ll have to be focused during the whole match in London to avoid any slip-up.
 Individually, Bayern’s class is on another level, with Ribery, Kroos, Mueller and Mandzukic all enjoying a great season so far. But Arsenal are also good up front, as Walcott, Podolski and Cazorla are fast and skilled enough to cause problems to Van Buyten and Dante. Even if they’re dangerous on the counter, though, the Gunners seem vulnerable at the back and that’s why they’re going to struggle against Bayern, a team capable of playing a 70 per cent possession match with ease. So it seems to be Bayern all the way, but don’t forget the Champions League is Champions League, and remember what happened to Chelsea last season...
 The comparison between Arsenal and a kindergarten bores me to death but some things never change. Arsenal is still a kindergarten, not in terms of the age of their players but in terms of their behaviour. They always lose to physical teams and they almost always don't win big games. Arsenal are able to create something interesting in one game, mainly due to their courage, but to win after two games they need something more than just courage. They need character, they need power of will and they need strength to overcome a huge opponent.
 I'm afraid that Arsenal have become the team who can run and gun against Readings only. And that's the reason Arsene Wenger should leave - even good things have an end. I'd say Arsenal will lose to Bayern Munich without any doubt.
 At this stage of the Champions League anything is possible, but that doesn't change the fact that Bayern are a strong favourite in the battle for a place in the quarter-final. Bayern are at the very top of their form and Arsenal's present level will not be enough. A defeat against German rivals should not influence Arsene Wenger's future at the club though. For him the most important thing is where the club finish in the Premier League.
 WINNER: Bayern Munich
 Anything is possible in the last-16 of the Champions League, except an Arsenal win. Bayern Munich are in unbelievable form. They have conceded only seven goals in 22 Bundesliga games. Besides their defensive performance, their offensive performance is extraordinary. And Arsenal lost in the FA Cup which was their only hope. They expect too much from players like Mertesacker, Giroud and Arteta. These players are not at the top level and this is their problem. We can’t expect that Arsenal will beat Bayern Munich.
 WINNER: Bayern Munich
 Arsenal still have the ability to produce a great performance but it rarely happens nowadays. They can probably disturb Bayern Munich in the first leg thanks to their attacking strength but over two meetings there is no chance. Arsene Wenger’s future at the club though is not in danger. As long as the club is profitable he will keep his job as long as he wants. Even if I feel his time at the club should be over.
 WINNER: Bayern Munich
 FINAL TALLY: ARSENAL 0, BAYERN MUNICH 9
