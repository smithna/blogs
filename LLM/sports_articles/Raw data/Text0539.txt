Wasps number eight Billy Vunipola was pressing hard for selection until he suffered an ankle injury in training at England's Surrey headquarters. As a result, Lancaster will select his starting side from the same matchday 23 that defeated Ireland 12-6 in Dublin, a result which left England top of the Six Nations table.
 "We had to make some close calls but the team did very well in Ireland so we've gone with the same squad against France," Lancaster said. "We are looking forward to getting back to Twickenham against what I am sure will be a highly motivated French team."
 England squad:
 Forwards - Dan Cole (Leicester Tigers), Dylan Hartley (Northampton Saints), James Haskell (London Wasps), Joe Launchbury (London Wasps), Courtney Lawes (Northampton Saints), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Geoff Parling (Leicester Tigers), Chris Robshaw (Harlequins), Mako Vunipola (Saracens), David Wilson (Bath Rugby), Thomas Waldrom (Leicester Tigers), Tom Wood (Northampton Saints), Tom Youngs (Leicester Tigers)
