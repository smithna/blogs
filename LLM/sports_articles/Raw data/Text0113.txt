OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) --  The Oklahoma City Thunder unloaded free-agent-to-be Eric Maynor in a trade deadline deal with Portland on Thursday, picking up a trade exception and the rights to Greek forward Georgios Printezis.
     
  Maynor had been a reliable backup for All-Star point guard Russell Westbrook over his first two seasons in Oklahoma City, ranking among the top 10 in the league in assist-to-turnover ratio. He missed almost all of last season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, but regained his spot in the Thunder rotation during training camp before getting replaced by second-year guard Reggie Jackson in mid-December.
  Maynor has played sparingly since, mostly in mop-up duty. He will be a restricted free agent at the end of the season.
  Printezis is playing overseas with Olympiacos.
