LEWIS HAMILTON admits he might need a miracle to challenge for the world title this year.
 		
Hamilton yesterday unveiled the new Mercedes W04 he hopes will take him to the front of the grid this season.
                    
                     But he knows he is taking a step into the unknown after leaving McLaren, the only team he has ever driven for.
                     
                     Hamilton said: "This year is about one step at a time. Finish the first race, getting on the podium, then trying to win races.
                     
                     This year is about trying to get ­settled in the team, get a good working relationship and steer this car in the right direction  and next years car.
                     
                     We have to deliver as a team, of course, but I am not a miracle ­worker. Im going to work as hard as I can to make steps forward."
                     
                     The target is to improve on last year, when they didnt have a strong year.
                     
                     They got one win, but they didnt have enough podiums, didnt have anywhere near the success they deserved.
                    
                     Hamilton will get his first chance to test his new wheels tom­orrow on the Spanish circuit of Jerez.
                     
                     Hamilton, 28, won four races last ­season, while Mercedes have only won one in the past three years.
                     
                     "It wont be until the next couple of days that I get a feel for it and understand in which direction to push the car," said Hamilton.
                     
                     "Im going in with an open mind, a blank sheet. I dont know what to expect. I just hope it has lots of downforce."
                     
                     Hamilton and new team-mate Nico Rosberg raced karts together as ­teenagers before graduating to F1.
                     
                     "Im sure it will work, said ­Rosberg. It worked well in go-karting for two years, so there is no reason why it cant work well again in F1.
                    
                     We were always up front battling for podiums and wins.
                     
                     I dont see why it cant be the same here, in that off the track we get on well, then have a big competition on track."
