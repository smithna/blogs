The 23-year-old midfielder became the fifth Frenchman to sign for the Magpies this month as he followed Mathieu Debuchy, Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, Yoan Gouffran and Massadio Haidara to St James' Park on Friday night.
  	Sissoko signed a six-and-a-half-year contract after Newcastle beat off competition from a series of other suitors to land him as they attempt to drag themselves out of relegation trouble.
  	The former Toulouse player said: "My personal objectives really are to finish off this season as best as we possibly can. I am going to give everything I can so Newcastle finish as high up the league as possible.
  	"For the future, I want Newcastle to be one of the very best teams in the Premier League. That's my wish and the club's also.
  	"I have signed here because I love the cub. They have some fantastic players.
  	"Newcastle aren't in the position where they should be at the moment, but I think if we all do well, we will finish as high as possible and really make the team one of the best in England."
  	The Magpies will hope to take a significant step towards safety on Tuesday evening when they head for fellow strugglers Aston Villa.
  	And the newcomers already know how important that game will be.
  	Sissoko said: "Tuesday night will be a difficult night. Aston Villa are also in a pretty poor position at the moment in the league.
  	"It's a match which we certainly can't afford to lose. We must make sure we are motivated for Tuesday night so we come away with a result."
