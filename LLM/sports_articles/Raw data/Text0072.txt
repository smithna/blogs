Reeve's third season in charge ended with a loss in the WNBA finals to the Indiana Fever. The Lynx beat the Atlanta Dream to win the championship the year before. Over three seasons under Reeve, Minnesota has won a league-best 67 games. Her .657 winning percentage ranks second in WNBA history. In 2012, the Lynx became the league's first team to start 10-0.
 In a statement issued by the team, Reeve said she was just as excited now as she was the day she was hired.
