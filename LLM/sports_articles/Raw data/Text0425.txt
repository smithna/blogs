Wonderboy Vettels sensational record in Newey-designed cars reads: 26 wins, 46 podiums, 36 pole placings and three successive crowns in just 100 outings.
                                          Newey, with Red Bull since 2006, said: Ive  always maintained I do not want to spend my entire career in motor racing and certainly not F1  but right now I am enjoying it.
                                          And as long as that is the case and people offer me work, then Ill keep doing it.
                                          At this team we keep egos and politics to a minimum and try to keep an atmosphere where theres no finger-pointing.
                                          We encourage creativity. And our results and titles show how all that has paid off.
                                          Vettel, the youngest-ever champ, revels in his tie-up with the design mastermind.
                                          He said: You need to feel happy in the team youre in and it is essential to have a competitive car. Right now I have them both.
                                          This is where Adrian is so brilliant. He gives me confidence and he designs world-beating cars. It is an incredible experience to work with him.
                                          The recordbuster, said to be about to extend his Red Bull contract, added: I think we can do even better.
