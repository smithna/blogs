Prior to 2012, Zack Greinke had never really pitched in a big city. Aside from some starts on the road, during which he took a team bus to the stadium, the 29-year-old has likely did not have to battle traffic all that often while pitching in places like Kansas City and Milwaukee. Now, $158 million has brought him to one of the most popular cities in America.

If all goes to plan, Greinke will have to attend 82 home games at Dodger Stadium with the Los Angeles Dodgers this season. That will likely mean sitting in a lot of traffic on the way to the ballpark, which is something the right-hander has been dreading so much that he looked into alternatives. Like, for example, helicopter travel.

“I did. I looked into it but I don’t think you can land at the stadium,” Greinke told Bill Plunkett of the Orange County Register. “It’s not as easy as it sounds.”

Greinke probably got a little taste of the California traffic while pitching with the Los Angeles Angels last season, but now he is stuck with it. If Magic Johnson and company really want to make their new ace comfortable, they might want to toss a helicopter pad somewhere near the stadium. They’ve spent enough money since taking over in an attempt to build a contender. What’s a few more bucks?

Then again, Greinke could always be like this NBA star and ride his bicycle to home games. That would help ease some of the traffic burden.
