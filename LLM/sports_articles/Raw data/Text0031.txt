BRENDAN RODGERS could be Kop boss for another 10 years but he will never  suffer such a heartbreaking victory.  
  A brilliant, incredible, against-all-odds win — but only the bitter, bitter  taste of defeat to wash it down.  
  Although Liverpool struck three times to leave the Russian champions on the  ropes, ultimately it counted for nothing.  
  Because Zenit St Petersburg, for all they spent longer on the canvas than Ivan  Drago when he got Rocky Balboa’s back up, are through to face Basel by the  most slender of margins.

  Rodgers said: “We got three goals, totally dominated the game and controlled  the game and should have had a penalty.  
 
  “So we’re bitterly disappointed. But I thought overall we were fantastic.  
  
  “Obviously, at two down from the first leg and then conceding again early on,  you might have thought the tie was over.  
 
  It was always going to be an uphill task to overturn that 2-0 deficit from a  week ago.  
 
  And heartbroken fans cannot say they did not get value for money after an  evening which began with a clanger.  
 
  How agonising, too, that the blunder which was to eventually cost so dear came  from the one man in red you have been able to set your watch by in terms of  reliability.  
 
  Steven Gerrard thundered into a loose-ball challenge on Sergei Semak on 19  minutes and the ball flew back and past Jamie Carragher on halfway.

  The Kop centre-back took the safety-first option in playing it all the way  back to keeper Pepe Reina, but failed to make proper contact and sent Hulk  clear to score.  
 
  Luis Suarez levelled with a 28th-minute free-kick through the Russian wall.  
 
  The Reds grabbed a second a couple of minutes before the break when Welshman  Joe Allen saw his first effort saved and then reacted brilliantly to stick  out a leg and turn in the rebound.  
 
  Liverpool were denied a penalty for hands by Tomas Hubocan who stooped to  reach a Suarez flick.

  But on 58 minutes the Russians were penalised for Neto’s challenge on Suarez  nearly 30 yards out.  
 
  The Uruguayan curled a magnificent effort around the wall and into the corner.  
 
  Reputations and careers are rarely made on the back of defeats.  
 
  Somehow, for Rodgers, you think it could be a different story.
