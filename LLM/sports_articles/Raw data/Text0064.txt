LEON CAMIER reckons he could finally break his World Superbike duck this weekend with a winning ride in the seasons Australian opener.
 		
The former British title winner is keen to regain the sparkling form of his early career after three tough campaigns so far on the world stage.
                    
                     The Fixi Suzuki rider has underlined his credentials by running at lap record pace at the coastal Philip Island circuit.
                     
                     Now he feels in good form after bouncing back from a massive crash last Friday.
                     
                     That wrecked his bike and left his team with a race against time to rebuild it ahead of yesterdays first day of official testing, but the incident did nothing to knock his confidence.
                     
                     He said: "Despite what happened we are in quite good shape at the moment.
                     
                     I just got caught out by the wind then and the bike was totalled but thankfully I was uninjured.
"                     
                     Camier repaid the hard work of his team by setting the pace, though it was a close-run thing ahead of his long-standing rival Leon Haslam, who is riding this season in the colours of Pata Honda.
                    
                     "We did a pretty good job. Its very close at the top, so it doesnt really count for anything because the race is going to be very difficult," said Camier.
                     
                     We needed to change some stuff after the bike had been rebuilt because, unfortunately, it didnt quite feel the same as it did before I smashed it up in last weeks crash.
                     
                     Ulsterman Eugene Laverty, heading up the Aprilia challenge following the retirement of world champion Max Biaggi, set the best time in the morning session but later slipped back to fourth.
