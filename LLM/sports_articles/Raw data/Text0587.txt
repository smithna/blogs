 
   	The free-agent left-hander and the Pirates have finalized their two-year deal, agreeing to adjusted terms after Liriano suffered a broken right arm over the holidays, according to major league sources.
  	Liriano, 29, reached preliminary agreement with the Pirates on a two-year, $12.75 million contract shortly before Christmas. He still could earn that entire sum but will assume more risk under the revised terms, sources said.
  	If Liriano misses time next season because of an ongoing problem with his right arm, his first-year salary will be reduced, according to a source. His second-year salary will remain the same as long as he is not sidelined because of the same specific injury.
  	Liriano was healthy all of last season, going a combined 6-12 with a 5.34 ERA for the Minnesota Twins and Chicago White Sox. He is 53-54 with a 4.40 ERA lifetime.
