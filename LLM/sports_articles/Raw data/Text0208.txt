Utah agreed Sunday to waive the veteran guard, who has been locked in a bitter dispute with the team and has not played a game since last April, along with paying him the $3.4 million remaining on his contract for this season. Bell has battled publicly with Jazz coach Tyrone Corbin, calling his boss unprofessional and refusing to suit up for Utah.

The 36-year old had attempted to negotiate a buyout of his contract last summer, with the Celtics among the teams interested in his services, but a deal failed to materialize. Since his waiving comes after March 1, Bell will not be eligible to play for another team in the playoffs this season.

Bell has played for seven different teams since entering the league in 2001, including two stints with the Jazz. Known more for his defense, he has averaged 9.9 points per game on 43.4 percent shooting over his career.

The Salt Lake Tribune’s Bill Oram reports that Utah has promoted Travis Leslie from the D-League to fill Bell’s roster spot.
