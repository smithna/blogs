Real Madrid are now determined to cash in on the club's £80m record signing, while Ronaldo's value is still at its peak.
 					 						
  According to reports in Spain, Real president Florentino Perez has finally grown fed up with the Portuguese forward's refusal to sign a new contract.
                                                               The 28-year-old's current contract expires in June 2015, with Ronaldo claiming he is "sad" at the Bernabeu earlier this season.
                                                               The former Manchester United star also recently stated his intention to see out the remainder of his contract at Real, but claimed "I do not know what will happen in the future".
                                                               Spanish newspaper El Pais reports it is these recent comments which have most angered Perez.
                                                               And the Real chief is now determined to cash in on the club's £80m record signing, while Ronaldo's value is still at its peak.
                                                               It is thought Perez will not even consider retaining Ronaldo to the end of his contract and allowing him to walk away for free.
                                                               Real will need the money from the sale of their prize asset to fund a replacement.
                                                               And Perez is also keen to splash out on an overhaul of the Real squad this summer, as he faces a presidential re-election campaign in upcoming months.
                                                               With boss Jose Mourinho and Ronaldo sharing the same agent in Jorge Mendes, Perez suspects it is Ronaldo's representative who is behind his continued snub of a new £26m per year contract.
                                                               Relations between Mourinho and the Real board have soured recently, following the manager's public fall-out with a number of the club's stars.
                                                               And Mourinho is set to leave the Spanish capital in May, with Perez wanting to back any new manager with substantial transfer funds.
                                                               Tottenham's Gareth Bale and Manchester City's David Silva are top of the list of Real's summer targets, along with Malaga starlet Isco and Brazil phenomenon Neymar.
                                                               Ronaldo has suitors in cash-rich French side PSG, with Manchester rivals City and United both likely to be interested in discussing a deal for the world-class talent.
