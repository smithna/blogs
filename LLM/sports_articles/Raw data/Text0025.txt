Mark Sanchez threw four interceptions and lost a fumble, Greg McElroy was named the new starter and Tim Tebow felt misled.

Sanchez could be traded, Tebow wants to be traded, Michael Vick wants to sign with the Jets and now Tebow has reportedly called it quits with his girlfriend.

Tebow broke up with Camilla Belle after two weeks of dating, according to US Weekly.

A source told the gossip magazine, “It just didn’t work out.”

Tebow’s week could only get worse at this point if he found out that McElroy had stolen Belle’s heart, along with his chance to start in the NFL.

It may be for the best. Tebow likely won’t be in New York much longer, and there’s not much work for an actress/model in Jacksonville.
