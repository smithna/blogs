Cappie Pondexter was confident going into the Haier Shooting Stars competition on NBA All-Star Saturday night and for good reason:  Team New York can shoot the ball.  And shoot they did, all the way to the Shooting Stars crown, as former Knick All-Star and current Assistant GM Allan Houston, and current Knick Landry Fields teamed up with WNBA All-Star and NY Liberty point guard Pondexter to best Team Atlanta, Team Orlando and competition finalist Team Texas.  
    "It was pretty easy," Pondexter told TNT's Cheryl Miller, herself no stranger to the art of shooting, after hoisting up the trophy with her Madison Square Garden brethren.  "We were focused."  
    Cappie wasn't kidding about focus as she went 4-for-4 on shots from the right side and baseline as part of the Team New York win.  The other WNBA competitors also strutted their stuff on Saturday night as both Marie Ferdinand-Harris (Team Orlando) and Lindsey Harding (Team Atlanta) hit the hardest shots of the night -- the dreaded half-court shots -- for their respective squads.  And Sophia Young helped Team Texas to the final round, only to fall to Cappie and the Knickerbockers.
