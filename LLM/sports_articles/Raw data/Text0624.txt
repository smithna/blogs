  The Italian finally called it a day after 21 months at the club following a period of unrest and a failed takeover bid.

                                                               I entered into a temporary arrangement with the proposed new owners to continue in my role but all this was agreed subject to Football League approval for the purchase of the Club being granted by 5pm on Monday, February 18.
                                                               I have had no further contact from the proposed new owners and I have been told unfortunately Football League approval has not been granted yet.
                                                               Therefore my temporary arrangement has ended and my resignation stands.
