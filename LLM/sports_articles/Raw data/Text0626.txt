The 27-year-old joined the west Londoners from Sunderland in 2011 but, after impressing last season, has struggled for form this term.

Ferdinand has found himself on the periphery of the first team as a result and now looks set for a move away from Loftus Road.

It is understood the centre-back is in talks with Bursaspor over a loan move, although it is unclear as to whether it is with a view to a permanent transfer.

The Turkish side is already home to England international goalkeeper Scott Carson and signed Stoke midfielder Maurice Edu on loan earlier this month.
