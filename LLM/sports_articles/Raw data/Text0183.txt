The 28-year-old will this year attempt to revive the fortunes of a team that has won just one grand prix in the three years since their return to the sport at the start of 2010.
                    
                     Hamilton is expected to deliver big things after quitting McLaren to sign a three-year contract worth £15m a season.
                     But he is convinced both he and his new team can deliver.
                     
                     "This is going to be an interesting year, an interesting journey, but I think its going to be a journey we ­enjoy," said Hamilton.
                     
                     "I live to win. Thats what I work ­towards every year, so thats what were going to work ­towards this year."
                     
                     "Of course its going to be tough to compete with guys who are already at the front  the Red Bulls, the McLarens, the ­Ferraris  but I dont think its impossible."
                     
                     A shake-up of the team yesterday left Ross Brawn on the verge of quitting after losing his role as team principal.
                     
                    Williams shareholder Toto Wolff was announced as their new executive director.
                     
                     And Hamilton could soon be reunited with McLarens top engineer, with ­Mercedes attempting to poach Paddy Lowe from their rivals.
                     
                     Wolff said: "Its all speculation. Ross is here as part of the leading team and I hope Ross is going to stay. 
                     
                     I have had conversations with Ross. I admire what Ross has done."
                     
                     Speaking before the reshuffle, Hamilton added: "To be back and to know Im part of the Mercedes world is a real privilege. 
                     
                     Im so grateful to be welcomed into the team and really excited.
                     
                     Ive been to Brackley (the ­Mercedes F1 base) in the early part of December, ­asking lots of questions, trying to get as involved as I can in the limited time that I was there."
                    
                     It was great to see just how enthusiastic everyone was.
                     
                     It looked like there was incredible determination to turn this around.
