'Gooch' has been a notable absentee as the Kingdom's Division One campaign got off to an inauspicious start with defeats to Mayo and Dublin, and manager Eamonn Fitzmaurice has confirmed that the talismanic attacker will also be omitted for the treacherous trips to Kildare and Donegal.
Cooper has picked up a few knocks during Dr Crokes' All-Ireland club bid, which ended with defeat to Ballymun Kickhams last weekend.
Revealing that the player is nursing an ankle injury and "another couple of bits and pieces", Finuge clubman Fitzmaurice says he's "giving him a chance to recuperate".
