Rubio was upset that he sat out the final minutes of the Timberwolves' 91-83 loss Wednesday night. He was especially agitated after he went to check into the game around the 4-minute mark but was called back to the bench when Porter decided to keep J.J. Barea in the game.
  	''I apologized to him because it came out like I was saying something against him, and I never went against him,'' Rubio said following a morning shootaround ahead of Friday night's game against the Washington Wizards. ''It was something against me, by myself, because I was frustrated with me because I didn't play. It was something that didn't have to be against him or the team.''
  	Rubio is on a strict limit of 28 minutes per game since returning last month from reconstructive left knee surgery. He had 4 minutes left on his allotment against the Nets, but Barea hit a 3-pointer while Rubio was waiting at the scorer's table.
  	Rubio said once he cooled down he understood Porter's decision.
  	''I didn't even need the talk because the next day I realized maybe I didn't deserve (to be in the game),'' Rubio said. ''Because J.J. was hitting the shots and he was able to get hot at some point and make a lot of points.''
  	Porter is running the team while coach Rick Adelman is away tending to his sick wife.
  	''I don't think it ever was really an issue,'' Porter said. ''He was frustrated like any player would be who wants to be playing the fourth quarter.''
