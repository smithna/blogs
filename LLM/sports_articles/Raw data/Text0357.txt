For the first time since 2002, Douglas is not spending the  winter months traveling between her home in Greece (with husband Vasilis) and  basketball stops throughout Europe. While playing professionally in Russia,  Spain, Turkey and Lithuania, Douglas has been a EuroLeague All-Star and a  regular veteran in EuroLeague competition, once leading all of Europe in  scoring and frequently competing with the top clubs on the continent. Absorbing  the cultures, the languages and the cuisine has become one of the favorite  staples of her worldly lifestyle.
  This winter though, she is spending the vast majority of her  time doing rehabilitation at St. Vincent Sports Performance on the northwest  side of Indianapolis where she consults with Fever doctors and trainers  regularly.
  Immediately after the Fever season ended and championship  hoopla subsided, Douglas was in a feverish mode to rehab and return to the  court. She had dressed for Game 4 of the Finals with sincere hopes of a  possible return in that series  albeit knowing she was not near 100 percent;  and also knowing her team was playing with just nine players after a Game 2  injury to Jeanette Pohlen.
  The whole game, I was nervous, for the team and myself.  Prior to the game, I had a talk with Coach [Dunn] and Kelly [Krauskopf] about playing  me. Id worked extremely hard and went through shootaround that day, but  everybody knew I was nowhere near 100 percent. With me and JP out, we were down  to 9 [players]. If somebody else went out, there might be a situation where I  might go in. I was extremely nervous, probably the most nervous Id ever been.  We were playing for a world championship. I wanted to be in there so bad, but I  didnt want to be a hindrance to the team.
  During and after the Finals, rehab was constant, though slow  and frustrating with continued swelling and pain. Weeks after the Fever  celebrations, she intended to make her debut with Wisla Can-Pack in Krakow,  Poland, in mid-November, but a re-evaluation revealed her ankle had not  completely healed.
  Plans to play in Poland were scrapped and team officials  with Wisla turned to fellow WNBA star Alana Beard, instead. Douglas turned to  her team of specialists and underwent surgery.
  Now, she visits the rehabilitation clinic usually twice a  day. She maintains her ordinary strength and cardiovascular conditioning and  spends the rest of her time between family and finding time for interests lost  playing professionally almost 12 months per year for the past decade.
  Life has been great living here in Indianapolis and  actually being an ordinary person. Everybody knows our schedule in the summer  with the WNBA schedule and responsibilities. Ive definitely been given a lot  of extra time with friends and family here. Its been amazing to reconnect with  a lot of different people. I have spent time around family friends and doing a  lot of things that I enjoy, that I like, that I cant do in other countries.
  People might not know that Im big into interior decorating  and design. I almost have my house in Florida (Ft. Myers) pretty good now. I  put a lot of work into it when I first got it, but usually I would just go down  there to enjoy myself. It was just a sanctuary for me and I wasnt putting much  effort into it. But in this time period, Ive been down there several times  just to clean, re-organize and do little projects that have been neglected  because I just didnt want to do them in the occasional 2-3 days at a time that  I used to spend there.
  I just got a new place here in Indy last February. I did a  lot with it in the summer, but now, having more free time, Ive comfortably  done even more of what I have wanted to do with the place. Im a very clean and  organized person. Being overseas usually for eight months at a time makes it  difficult to stay organized. Ive been able to get caught up on paperwork and  other things that have been neglected for so long.
  But for strengthening the ankle, Douglas body and mind are  as healthy as ever. She has never had this much time between the stress and  pressure of travel and playing games and leading her teams. 
  The 33-year old knows she still has multiple years left in  her playing career, but thoughts of anything beyond the short-term are purely  secondary. Goals now are singular  she has immediate sights set on resuming  basketball activity, including a return to action overseas before beginning the  2013 WNBA season with Fever teammates inside Bankers Life Fieldhouse.
  I took maybe a week off after we won, but ever since that  time Ive been lifting and doing cardio as much as I could. I feel about the  strongest I ever have been in my whole career. When youre overseas, you have  travel and games and hard practices, but this has given me a chance to take  care of my body. My body feels awesome and mentally, I feel rested because Im  working out just for me.
  The first and sole focus right now is on my ankle. Im  ahead of schedule and definitely looking forward to the next step which is  getting back on the court.
  As her rehab and preparation continues, Douglas took the rare  moment to reflect on the Fevers recent title  special to her as an  Indianapolis native who initiated trade conversation to return to Indy in 2008,  despite the pressure to perform for her hometown team.
  I think Ill always remember that moment where were all on  the podium and holding the trophy finally. So many times we have done crazy  little TV promos with the trophy; so many times I have been teased by the  trophy and so many times I have been that other team walking off the floor  without it. It felt so good to have that trophy in my hands. I think holding  that trophy will be what I remember the most.
  Without a doubt, no question about it, I felt a sense of  relief in finally winning a title. Theres a lot of pressure playing in front  of your hometown, that I put on myself [when I wanted to come back here], but  it definitely feels good to win a championship here.
  The small-town girl who helped bring Indianapolis a  championship trophy still yearns for more, both in the WNBA and in a modern life  of around-the-world travel.
  I just love the game. I cant envision my life without  playing. I set goals for myself every offseason, no matter my age, to improve  on my weaknesses and even my strengths. I never really imagined going and  living overseas half the year, every single year, but its made me who I am as  a person. I really wouldnt change anything that Ive done. Im proud of what  Ive done and accomplished, but Im still very much an Indiana girl at heart.  Ive been all over the world. Basketball has taken me so many places and Ive  been blessed to do that. My roots, though, are here and I always want to  maintain a life here.
  No matter her eventual legacy, Katie Douglas can take great  pride in helping her city to its first professional basketball championship  since 1973. But before any concerns with legacy and long-term goals, Douglas remains  focused on her return to the court  sooner, rather than later.
