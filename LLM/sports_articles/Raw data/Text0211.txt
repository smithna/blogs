Alberto Paloschi sealed a smash and grab win for the Flying Donkeys, who needed just one sight of goal to snatch the points against a wasteful, and slightly off-colour, Lazio.
  	The home side had the better of the game without really testing Christian Puggioni in the Chievo goal enough to warrant more than what they got.
