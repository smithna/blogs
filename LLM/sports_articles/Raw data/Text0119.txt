 		 	The Chicago Cubs, adding another veteran to their outfield, have reached agreement with free agent Scott Hairston on a two-year contract, according to major league sources.
  	
 	For some broods, baseball is in the blood, like these MLB dynasties.
 
   	Hairston, 32, figures to platoon with another free-agent signee, Nate Schierholtz, in right field. David DeJesus is projected to be in center and Alfonso Soriano in left.
  	The New York Mets, New York Yankees, Philadelphia Phillies and Atlanta Braves were among the other clubs to show interest in Hairston, who lingered on the market while trying to land a two-year deal.
  	Hairston, a right-handed hitter, spent last season with the Mets, batting .263 with an .803 OPS, 20 homers and 57 RBI in 398 plate appearances. He is particularly effective against left-handed pitchers, with an .825 OPS against them in his nine-year career.
  	Schierholtz, meanwhile, is a left-handed hitter with an .811 OPS against right-handed pitching over the past two seasons.
