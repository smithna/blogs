The most decorated gymnast in U.S. history was hoping to get pregnant again when doctors discovered a germ cell malignancy, a form of ovarian cancer, in late 2010. Germ cell malignancies are not the same as what most people think of as ovarian cancer, generally occurring in teenagers and women under 30. But the consequences can be just as dire. The ovary with the tumor was removed in January 2011, and Miller then had nine weeks of chemotherapy. She says she is now cancer-free.
  	Miller is a two-time world all-around champion. She won seven Olympic medals and nine at the world championships.
