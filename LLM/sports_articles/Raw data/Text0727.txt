West can sign with any NBA team while with the Legends, who play in the Dallas suburb of Frisco. The Legends acquired him because they were next in line to pick up players from the D-League player pool when West joined it.
  	Part of West's value a year ago came from being a younger, experienced player to help point guard Jason Kidd and Jason Terry. The Mavericks now have a much younger backcourt in Darren Collison and O.J. Mayo.
  	West, a first-round pick by Boston in the 2004 NBA Draft, averaged 9.7 points and 3.6 assists per game for his career, which also included stops in Cleveland and Dallas. West helped his team to the postseason in six of his eight seasons in the NBA.
  	The Texas Legends, with the addition of West, currently have five former first-round picks on the roster, and West also makes the seventh player on the current roster with NBA experience (Justin Dentmon, Melvin Ely, Luther Head, Rashad McCants, Sean Singletary, Delonte West and Sean Williams).Â
