The 25-year-old forward has been used sparingly by the La Liga side this term, prompting the player to look abroad for his next move.
                                          And Atletico are likely to allow the Adrian to leave at the end of the season, as he is refusing to sign a new contract at the Vicente Calderon, reports Spanish newspaper AS.
                                          Adrian was a January target for Arsenal, with the winger keen on a move to the Emirates.
                                          But Gunners' boss Arsene Wenger is thought to have cooled his interest in the Spain international.
                                          As a result, Adrian will have a choice between Liverpool and Spurs if he decides on a move to England.
                                          There is a release clause of around Â£15m in Adrian's current contract.
