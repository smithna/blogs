   	The initial deal was nullified when a health concern arose as part of Napoli's physical exam.
  	Incentive clauses in the contract could allow Napoli to earn as much as $13 million in 2013, according to one source. That number carries significance, since it represents what would have been the average annual value of the initial contract. In other words, if Napoli is healthy and productive, he has a chance to make as much money this year as he originally hoped.
  	The revised agreement was first reported by Rob Bradford of WEEI.com.
