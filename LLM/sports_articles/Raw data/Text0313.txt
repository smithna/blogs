PAUL INCE admitted it was strange taking over as Blackpool boss having been a fan for 14 months.
 		
  The former Blackburn and MK Dons boss, 45, signed a one-year rolling contract yesterday with the Seasiders, where son Tom has been a star since 2011.
                                                               He said: "Considering Ive watched the team play for the last 14 months, its strange sitting here as the manager, having watched Blackpool as a fan as well as watching my son play.
                                                               Im over the moon. Its great to be back on the training ground and great to be involved with, and in charge of, a great bunch."
