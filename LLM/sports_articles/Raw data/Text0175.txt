Following the ease with which Utd navigated the task of Fulham, they enter the fifth round of the draw. In terms of preferences, perhaps the date of the tie becomes relevant as it will be played after Utd meet Real Madrid for the first time. Will this affect the choice of player, do you think? Itâ€™s better after that game, than before, in which case I would expect most key players rested. After the game, and I would say it depends on the state of the players, but hopefully Utd will have put in the effort against Madrid that forces a few younger players to take over temporarily. With regards to the draw, big teams still included are Man City, Arsenal and Everton. Chelsea will replay after drawing at Brentford, with Tottenham losing 2-1 to Leeds and Liverpool losing 3-2 to Oldham. Here follows the fifth round draw:
 So there we are. Reading. Ties to be played over the weekend of 16th/17th February. Premier League opposition again for Utd, but a relatively good tie. To confirm, Utd will play Reading at home in the fifth round.
