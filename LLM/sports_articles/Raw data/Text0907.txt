LIVERPOOL AGREE COUTINHO FEE
In case you missed it last night, Liverpool have reportedly agreed a fee of around £8.5million for Philippe Coutinho.

Reds officials have flown to Milan to finalise a deal for the Inter playmaker and the transfer should be completed by Monday.

Full story here.


PREM RIVALS EYE BENTEKE
There hasn't been much joy at Aston Villa this season and it seems more grey clouds are gathering as several Premier League clubs eye a move for Christian Benteke.

The Belgian international looked a gamble when he joined for £7.5million in the summer, but Paul Lambert's successful pursuit of the striker has proved to be the best decision the manager has made at Villa Park.

However, according to The Mirror Benteke is now a target for Spurs, Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City after bagging 11 goals in 25 appearances for struggling Villa this season.

Spurs are thought to be leading the race for the 22-year-old, but he impressed in Villa's 3-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield and Brendan Rodgers is also listed as an admirer.

Benteke is set to stay at Villa until the summer at least as he already played for two clubs this season, but the relegation battlers will struggle to hold on to their star player whose value has doubled to around £15million.


READING TARGET TOM INCE
According to The People, Reading are hoping to hijack Liverpool's move for Tom Ince by making an £8million bid for the winger this week.

Liverpool and Blackpool have been in protracted negotiations for Ince since the start of the transfer window, with reports last week claiming that Tangerines chairman Karl Oyston is now refusing to answer the phone to the Reds.

That has paved the way for Reading to sneak in, although Ince may prefer to wait until the summer to see if the Royals retain their Premier League status.

Swansea are also interested in Ince, but it seems that a move to Liverpool could almost be dead with Philippe Coutinho close to joining the Reds.


BEGOVIC HOPES FOR UNITED MOVE
There has been plenty of talk about David De Gea's future at Old Trafford over the past week and if the Spanish youngster leaves United in the summer, Asmir Begovic is thought to be the number one candidate to replace him.

The Mirror claim Begovic is desperate to join the league leaders and apparently he would turn his back on interest from Man City, Arsenal and Liverpool to make the move happen.

The Mirror report: 'De Gea could be allowed to move back to Spain to either Real Madrid or Barcelona, with Begovic the top choice to replace him.

'Friends of Begovic claim the 25-year-old is particularly excited by United's interest, but he would have reservations about agreeing to move to City and starting next season on the subs' bench under Hart.

'Begovic is under contract to Stoke until 2016, and manager Tony Pulis will demand £15million for the goalkeeper he signed from Portsmouth for just £3m.'


UNITED EYE NEW DEFENDER
Quick line from The People now, who claim Manchester United are plotting bids for Benfica defender Ezequiel Garay and Torino centre-back Angelo Ogbonna.

Argentina international Garay, who moved to Portugal from Real Madrid in 2011, would cost around £25million and apparently United scouts see him as the ideal successor to Rio Ferdinand.

Ogbonna was included in Italy's Euro 2012 squad after gaining promotion with Torino last season, and it's thought United could face competition for his signature from a number of Serie A clubs.
