talkSPORT  ran the rule over  Cuevas  earlier this month after revealing that Chelsea were keen on the rising star.
 And now the 17-year-old has revealed a deal has been completed that will result in the attacking midfielder moving to Stamford Bridge.
 "Everything went very quickly and everything was settled this week," the player said on Radio Cooperativa. "Chelsea were following me for over a year and we finally reached an agreement."
 The youngster was sent off in his last outing in the Chilean top-flight but the two goals he scored in the South American U-20 tournament earlier in the year had already convinced the Blues of his talent.
 "I am already taking English classes so I can integrate quickly. It will be a big change," he added. "I could account for all the differences there were when I was there. But I am calm and very happy."
 The date for his official arrival has not been arranged but it is likely to occur after the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup will be held in Turkey which ends on the 13th July.
