CRISTIANO RONALDO faces Manchester United this week with Sir Bobby Charlton insisting Old Trafford is the place he is appreciated most.

Ronaldo takes on his former club for the first time since his world-record £80million move to Real Madrid, in the Champions League last-16 first leg in the Bernabeu.

And United legend Charlton, now an Old Trafford director, makes no secret of the fact that he would love to see Ronaldo, 28, back at his club.

Sir Bobby said: “I love Cristiano. I was really, really sorry when he left us but we couldn’t stop him leaving.

“Playing for Real Madrid was something he had to do in his football life.

“But I always wonder what sort of treatment he is getting at Madrid and whether he can match what happened at Old Trafford and the affection that was shown to him.

“They loved him at Old Trafford and still do. People are asking me, ‘Is there any chance, if Real Madrid fall out with him, that maybe we could bring him back?’

“I always say, well, we’ll have to wait and see. He is a great footballer – and we will enjoy playing against him.”

Ronaldo has been even more prolific at Real than he was at United and the fact that he is now set to face the club where he became a global superstar adds further spice to what is an exciting two-legged tie.

Charlton says of the battle between two of the most famous clubs in the world: “When the draw was made it sent a shiver down my spine.

“My first introduction to European football really was watching Real Madrid – with the likes of Alfredo Di Stefano and Francisco Gento.

“We learned so much. Madrid gave us so much, really. We have always had an affection for each other.

“If I have to do something to do with Real Madrid, then I would do it. Can I think of a bigger club match in football than Real Madrid v Man United? The answer is ‘no’ – unless you maybe involve Barcelona. They have a sense of adventure about them. Real and ourselves are the two biggest-supported clubs in world football. It’s fantastic, it will be a great contest.

“I think it could come down to who is lucky at the time with injuries and suspensions.

“But Real have always had the right approach to the game. They are determined to have the best players – no matter how much they cost.

“They seem to have everybody’s affection. That probably comes from them winning the first five European Cups – that was frightening.

“But we learned how to handle them and we weren’t totally beaten by them. We had our moments and maybe we will have more moments in the next two matches against them, starting in Madrid on Wednesday.”

Charlton is happy to talk in glowing terms about Real Madrid – but has ­always been reluctant to discuss their manager Jose Mourinho (left) in similar terms.

Mourinho has been touted as a potential successor to United boss Sir Alex Ferguson.

Perhaps that is why Charlton claims Mourinho “sometimes tries to sell himself”.

But Sir Bobby, recognised as England’s most famous footballer, said: “Alex respects people in the game if they have made a contribution and rightly so – and Mourinho has.

“There’s no way I can put the record straight on Mourinho because I don’t really know him that well. 

“I will leave all that to Alex. What I know is that Alex is the greatest manager that there has ever been.

“Who am I to say what Mourinho is going to do? I don’t know – I suppose it takes all sorts.”

What Charlton is confident about is that Mourinho’s Madrid and Fergie’s United are about to produce a Champions League classic.

He just wishes Ronaldo was wearing red in these two games, rather than white.
