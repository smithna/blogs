MAX CHILTON will join Jenson Button, Lewis Hamilton and Paul di Resta on the grand prix launch pad next season after comparing F1 to rocket science.
 		
The 21-year-old from Surrey will become the fourth British driver after impressing Marussia enough in test and practice sessions at races to be offered a full-time contract.
                    
                     He will be the fourth rookie partner for the teams experienced driver, Timo Glock, as he replaces Frenchman Charles Pic.
                     
                     Chilton finished fourth in last seasons GP2 Series, taking two wins and two pole positions, and attended six F1 races as the Marussia test driver. 
                     
                     F1 is like rocket science  its completely at a different end of the scale from GP2, said Chilton, who drove with his F1 heroes for the first time in the first practice session at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in November.
                     
                     That was like trying to ski for the first time, with everyone watching, without being allowed to fall over. 
                     
                     
					 "I did a good job. I didnt want to get in the way of people like Schumacher, who started the year I was born, or Jenson. It went OK."
                    
                     Backing from his father, Grahame, a multi-millionaire and top executive at the AON insurance company, has helped Chilton and his brother Tom, who races in the World Touring Car Championship, but he insists his success will be down to himself.
                     
                     He said: "People obviously look at it and say, Youve got the money to do it, but my dad has always said, Ill get you as high as I can but F1 I cant do. We have managed to find two sponsors."
