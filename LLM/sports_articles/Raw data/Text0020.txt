The newly formed team submitted an entry to the Automobile Club de l’Ouest (ACO) to compete in the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans and will also field a minimum two-car effort in the 2013 American Le Mans Series.
  	
 	After entertaining sports fans, these athletes went on to entertain as actors.
 
   	Del Piero is a current star player for Sydney FC, but the soccer legend’s career includes being the former franchise player and captain for Juventus Football Club S.p.A., and 2006 World Cup Champion.
  	“I have had a passion for motorsport since I was a young boy growing up in Italy” Del Piero said. “I am thrilled at the opportunity to team with Patrick. We expect to compete at a very high level and our central focus will be on winning championships.”
  	The new team, based in the United States, listed Dempsey, Joe Foster and Michael Avenatti as drivers on its 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans entry. Avenatti and Foster are also principals with the new team. Filippo Marchino will serve as a consultant to the team.
  	“We are thrilled to have submitted an entry to the 24 Hours of Le Mans and anxiously await news from the ACO Selection Committee,” Foster said. “We would be honored to have the privilege to race at Le Mans and 2013 promises to be a very exciting year for the team and our partners.”
  	Dempsey/Del Piero Racing expects to announce further details on its plans for Le Mans and ALMS, and unveil the car livery, sponsorship and driver lineups, in the coming weeks.
