Shortly before halftime Sunday Kyle Rudolph cradled a lofted touchdown pass to the corner of the end zone.
A couple hours later, Rudolph got his hands on a Pro Bowl MVP trophy.
Rudolph highlighted the Minnesota Vikings contingent's night at the NFL's Pro Bowl Sunday, as he hauled in five receptions for 122 yards and one score to earn the game's top individual honor, leading the NFC to a 62-35 win over the AFC.
"Guys were competing, guys wanted to win and guys want to keep the game here (in Hawaii)," Rudolph insisted afterward. "That was the point before the game. We want to keep this game rolling for future Pro Bowlers."
The Vikings' fun in the sun this week was exemplified best with 7 minutes, 55 seconds remaining in Sunday's game. At that moment, Minnesota fullback Jerome Felton dove in for a short touchdown run behind a block from Vikings teammate Matt Kalil. Minnesota's rookie kicker, Blair Walsh, then tacked on the extra point, handing the NFC a decisive 62-28 advantage.
A glance at the Vikings' individual stats in Sunday's Pro Bowl shows more Minnesotans than just Rudolph held their own. Felton had 18 rushing yards to go along with his short scoring run. Peterson had five carries for 13 yards. Walsh totaled 14 points and went 2-for-2 on field goals, including a 48-yarder. Linebacker Chad Greenway was credited with two tackles and a fumble recovery. Allen was credited with one tackle for the NFC.
Even as the NFC piled up touchdowns, the game struggled for memorable moments otherwise. Giants wideout Victor Cruz, however, broke a Pro Bowl record with 10 catches.
