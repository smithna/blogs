Tamika Catchings will help Indiana try to defend its WNBA title.

The team said Tuesday that Catchings and starting guards Briann January Shavonte Zellous have all signed multi-year contracts to stay with the team. Terms were not released.

Fever president Kelly Krauskopf says she wants the 13-year veteran to finish her career in Indiana.

January, the point guard, averaged 10.0 points and 3.8 assists through the regular season and 11.5 points and 3.8 assists in the playoffs. Zellous became a starter during the playoffs and averaged 10.6 points in the postseason.
