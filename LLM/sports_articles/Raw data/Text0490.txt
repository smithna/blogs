But that's reportedly what Cam Cameron did after the Baltimore Ravens decided to part ways with him as the team's offensive coordinator last month.
  	"It was a brilliant move," Cameron told The New York Times. "Everyone on the team took a look in the mirror after that."
  	The Ravens were 9-4 and averaging 344.4 yards on offense when Cameron was fired on December 10. Since then, the Ravens have improved on offense under Jim Caldwell, averaging 406.2 yards over the final three regular-season games and 424.7 yards during their run to the Super Bowl.
  	Ravens coach John Harbaugh, in fact, said the decision to fire Cameron was "the hardest thing I've ever had to do as a coach."
  	Cameron, though, said the move to let him go was the right one because it put the entire team on alert.
  	"We were inconsistent, and if I'm in charge, I'm saying, 'Why are we inconsistent?' We need to get the team's attention," Cameron told the Times.
  	Cameron reportedly has no ill will toward the Ravens and says he's been rooting for them in the playoffs. He interviewed for the New York Jets' offensive coordinator position but didn't get the job.
