It will take much more than a last-16  triumph over mediocre Championship opponents to make amends for the events of recent weeks, of course.
Roberto Mancini has seen his sides title defence left in ruins after a woeful run of just two points from the last three games.
                                          
                                          He was on a hiding to nothing here and knew the best he could hope for was that the Blues beat whatever was put in front of them. 
                                          
                                          Leeds were no match for the top-flight giants who breezed into the quarter-finals to provide Mancini with some light relief thanks to goals from Yaya Toure, Carlos Tevez and Sergio Agueros double.
                                          
City won the FA Cup in 2011 to end their long wait for a trophy. And such is the mounting pressure on the Italian that he might have to land it again in May if he wants to extend his stay with the  billionaires beyond the summer. 
                                          
                                          With the vultures circling, Mancini knew there could be no slip-ups here.
                                         
                                          Last weeks humiliating 3-1 defeat at Southampton saw City fall 12 points behind Manchester United in the title race.
                                          
                                          This was Mancinis last hope of landing some silverware this season and he  wielded the axe as promised, making six changes.
                                          
                                          Among those left out were Joe Hart,  Joleon Lescott, Samir Nasri and Edin Dzeko, while Gareth Barry was sidelined with injury.
                                          
                                          Mancini recalled Tevez, who had been missing on compassionate leave, along with Toure, his brother Kolo and left-back Aleksandar Kolarov.
                                         
                                          Opposite number Neil Warnock found himself in a similar domestic situation, knowing Leeds chances of promotion were slim at best and that this was the last hurrah of the campaign.
                                          
                                          Yet any hopes Warnock had of a famous victory were dead and buried within the first 15 minutes. Mancinis men looked right up for the fight from the off and the champions tore into Leeds like their lives depended on it.
                                         
                                          They took the lead inside five minutes when Tevezs clever flick sent Toure past a static Leeds defence and he rounded Jamie Ashdown before finishing into an open goal.
                                          
                                          David Silva then lashed a powerful drive inches wide before Agueros clever run and unselfish pass set up Tevez, but his effort curled into the side netting.
                                         
                                          The writing was on the wall and it spelt serious danger for Leeds, who went 2-0 down inside 14 minutes when referee Mark Clattenburg awarded the home side a soft spot-kick.
                                          
                                          Tom Lees was attempting to challenge Aguero but Clattenburg penalised him for pulling back the Argentine, even though replays suggested he had merely brushed his arm across his chest. Aguero picked himself up to beat Ashdown and double Citys advantage.
                                          
                                          The one-way traffic continued with Sam Byram almost diverting Kolarovs free-kick into his own goal before Toure lashed a piledriver inches over.
                                         
                                          Warnock stood on the sidelines looking perplexed, powerless to stop the blue waves crashing into his defence as the pressure kept piling up.
                                         
Javi Garcia flashed a header just wide and Leeds were relieved to get to half-time just a couple of goals down.
                                          
                                          Warnock replaced ex-City midfielder Michael Brown and Ross McCormack with Steve Morison and David Norris at the restart in the hope it would give his side a foothold.
                                          
                                          But within seven minutes the Elland Road underdogs found themselves even further behind when Tevez pounced to extend the lead.
                                          
                                          Aguero was the provider this time,  exchanging clever passes with the  impressive Silva before picking out Tevez who finished from point-blank range.
                                          
                                          James Milner, facing his home-town club, then fired into the side netting as Mancinis men went up through the gears.
                                        
                                          Sub Jack Rodwell was given a rare 30 minutes to shine but managed to hit the bar instead of score with a simple header soon after replacing Garcia.
                                          
                                          Chances at the opposite end were like gold dust but Luke Varney wasted a good one with 19 minutes left when his header looped over from close range.
