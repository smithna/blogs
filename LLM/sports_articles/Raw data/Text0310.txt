Hes got so much more to give. He is an inspiration to everyone at the club and has been since he arrived
 					 						
  
  "I am not going to entertain that. I dont want to think about it," he said. 
                                                               Lampard looks set to leave Stamford Bridge at the end of the season when his contract runs out.
                                                               His goal in the 4-0 FA Cup win over Brentford on Sunday was his 199th for the club, three short of Bobby Tamblings club record. But owner Roman Abramovich shows no sign of offering him a new deal.
                                                               Terry, 32, and Lampard, 34, are in their 12th year together at Chelsea. Speaking of his pals future, Terry said: We all hope thats here but, if not, hes got years ahead of him.
                                                               Hes got so much more to give. He is an inspiration to everyone at the club and has been since he arrived.
                                                               After playing in the FA Cup tie, only his fourth game in three months since Rafa Benitez arrived, Terry denied reports of a bust-up with the boss.
                                                               He said: "When Rafa came, I wasnt fit. Hes not seen me at 100 per cent. I have to fight for my place again. But 100 per cent, theres no rift."
                                          DAVID LUIZ will escape punishment for flattening Brentfords Jake Reeves. Referee Neil Swarbrick booked the Brazilian, so the FA are powerless to act.
