ARSENE WENGER thinks Olivier Giroud is getting ready to rumble – and Arsenal are beginning to reap the rewards of the fired-up Frenchman.

The man from Montpellier has taken time to settle at the Emirates Stadium following his summer switch.

But his two goals on Saturday – coming four days after his double against West Ham – took his season’s tally to 14.

Not bad for a player finding his feet in a new country.

Not that Giroud thought he would have any problems adapting to life in the Premier League.

As far as the striker is concerned, he has always been destined to play in England where a bit of rough and tumble is still part of the game.

The only possible surprise is that the big, powerful centre foward has found a natural home at Arsenal, the club where star strikers have been more likely to break the mould than batter a centre-half.

Wenger admits he shifted from his normal policy when he picked out Giroud as the successor to Robin van Persie.

But recent performances suggest it could be a much neater fit than first imagined during a difficult start to the season.

Wenger said: “When he gets in the fighting mode he is difficult to handle. He is tall, strong, he is quicker than people think he is.

“He could have played 20 years ago in England, 10 years ago and today, because he has everything you need to play centre-forward. 

“Usually we go more for mobile players who are just on the move, but he gives us something different, and I believe with him and Theo Walcott we have a good partnership.

“Without him up front today it would have been difficult. It is no coincidence that Giroud and Walcott were not at Bradford. We had a lot of the ball but we did not score.”

Giroud said: “I chose this championship because there is more intensity, more physicality, you have to be ready in an athletic way. I like it but I like to play good football as well.”

And after sitting on the bench in recent weeks while Walcott was given a run up front, Giroud reckons the past few days have been an important stage in his Gunners career.

He added: “I’ve had a lot of time to play. I had a difficult time a couple of weeks ago when I didn’t play a lot so I had to keep confident, keep going.

“We want to get six points against Liverpool and Stoke now to reach Tottenham and fourth place. Then we will play and see where we get.”

Giroud’s goals certainly didn’t come from brute force alone and helped spare Wenger an embarrassing inquest into his decision to leave Walcott and Jack Wilshere on the bench.

The striker showed a superb touch to twice put Arsenal ahead, first with a curling leftfoot shot and then with a neat piece of control and cool finish. 

Brighton rallied on both occasions through Ashley Barnes’ header and a strike from debutant Leonardo Ulloa. 

But the Premier League side avoided a replay and booked a place in the fifth round through Walcott’s deflected winner six minutes from time.

Brighton boss Gus Poyet agreed Giroud was too much for his defence to handle but hopes Ulloa – the Argentine striker signed from Almeria last week – can learn from watching the Frenchman.

He said: “Giroud was very strong. At Championship level, Leo should give us that power, holding and strength.

“We lost and I don’t like it but it was a good start for Leo, he scored, he was feeling the atmosphere which was incredible at that time and we’ll see where that takes us.”
