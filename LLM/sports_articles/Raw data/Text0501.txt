BEIRUT: Defending champions Champville  tied the longest winning streak of the season, with their eighth consecutive victory coming after narrowly beating Mouttahed 98-94 Sunday in round 15 of the Lebanese Basketball League. Sagesse  had previously won eight straight games at the beginning of the season, and Champville looked on course to tie that record from the outset. The defending champions came firing out of the blocks, leading 16-8 midway through the first quarter.
The imposing trio – Fadi al-Khatib, Nikoloz Tskitishvili and Reyshawn Terry – again proved a force to be reckoned with, threatening from all angles of the court. Champville were on fire from behind the arc, making most of their shots to lead 30-23 in the first break.
The hosts faced a little scare as head coach Ghassan Sarkis  was forced to bench Khatib after the team captain committing his third foul.
Mouttahed were up for the fight in the second, with Bassel Bawji relishing the contact on his way to the basket. And Mohammad Akkari  got in on the act with eight straight points, including two triples, as the Tripoli  side came within three points at halftime 47-44.
The third was just as hard-fought, with Mouttahed leveling the score 50-50, as American forward Marc Salyers  continued to lead the visitors’ attack.
But Terry began to use his considerable size advantage to keep the home side up by four midway through the third. Nadim Souaid  also starred for his side, delivering in decisive moments as Champville led 68-62.
But Bawji produced again on his way to 21 points and seven rebounds.
He and teammate Rony Fahed helped Mouttahed lead 71-70 going into the final quarter.
But the potential game-changer came just moments later – with former Lebanon international Fahed drawn into committing his fifth foul of the game. The combo guard scored 12 points in 19 minutes.
The game remained tightly poised with Salyers and Bawji contributing offensively, as the Tripoli side sniffed an unlikely victory, leading 82-81, five minutes from time.
But Champville once again showed their experience down the stretch.
Terry demonstrated his determination with a superb and timely one-handed dunk to light up the crowd and pick up the momentum for his side.
He topped the charts with 30 points and six rebounds.
Mouttahed had the chance to level the score with 12 seconds left, but Salyers’ effort was in vain as Champville showed great composure when converting their free throws to secure their eighth straight win.
Alongside Terry, Khatib had 19 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, while Tskitishvili added 16 points and 13 rebounds. Karl Sarkis  also contributed with 15 points including three 3-pointers.
Bawji and Salyers were the joint top scorers for Mouttahed with 21.
The result means Champville are now second, at least for 24 hours, with an 11-4 record, while Mouttahed remain in fourth place at 9-6.
Elsewhere, League leaders Sagesse overcame a furious Byblos  rally to grab an 82-76 win at Ghazir Stadium.
The last times both teams met, Sagesse needed double overtime to overcome Byblos away from home 123-115. And another close contest seemed on the cards, with the home side leading 8-7 after four minutes.
The result saw Sagesse improve their record to 13-2 in pole position.
Meanwhile, Byblos lost for the second straight game to stay in sixth place with 8-6.
Aaron Harper  top scored for Sagesse with 25 points, nine rebounds and six assists, while Deshawn Sims added 21 points and 10 rebounds, and Elie Rustom  added 11 points. Youngblood led the scoring for Byblos with 20 points, and Mike Fraser  added 16 points and game-high 19 rebounds.
In the weekend’s only other fixture, Bejjeh narrowly beat home side Anibal Zahle  83-81 to move away from the bottom spot.
American Harold Jamison  top scored for the Jbeil side turning in 26 points and eight rebounds, overshadowing Tarek Ammoury’s 20 for Anibal.
Bejjeh remained in seventh place with 5-10, while Anibal stayed rooted to the bottom at 2-13.
