MIAMI — Chris Bosh will head to Massachusetts for Sunday's game at Boston. One day, he expects to return to the state for induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame.
 
Bosh always has had plenty of confidence. Now, he's talking about how he will be enshrined in Springfield, Mass.
 
"Hell, yeah, of course. I've been a Hall of Famer like four years ago," the Miami Heat center told FOX Sports Florida after Friday's 110-88 win over Detroit. "And I say that very serious, though. I've talked about it before with my friends."

Bosh has career averages of 19.7 points and 9.0 rebounds. But something happened with the 10-year veteran Thursday that might have clinched his trip to Springfield.
 
Bosh, averaging 17.2 points and 7.2 rebounds, was named to his eighth All-Star Game. The only eligible player in history with eight or more NBA All-Star selections who is not in the Hall is eight-time pick Larry Foust, a center who averaged 13.7 points and 9.8 rebounds from 1950-62.
 
"With eight, I'm so thankful for that," said Bosh, who was intrigued to hear about the above stat. "It never gets old. Just to be able to have that opportunity to be an All-Star, it's just incredible for me."
 
But before Bosh is ready to book passage to Springfield, there is a Hall of Famer who said it's premature to say Bosh is a lock to be enshrined. That would be Heat assistant coach Bob McAdoo, who won three scoring titles while playing in the NBA from 1972-86 and then also starred overseas.
 
"It's hard to say," McAdoo said of it being assured Bosh eventually will join him in the Hall. "You don't know the credentials they're looking for. A lot of times, you never know. It's still too early."
 
But one guy who is a lock for the Hall of Fame expects to have company in Bosh, in his third season with the Heat after seven in Toronto.
  
"He's on the right path," said Heat guard Dwyane Wade. "To be in a position where he has a lot of years left, he has a championship under his belt. If we can continue to get more and he can continue to be productive, no question about it."
 
Bosh turns 29 on March 24. Playing alongside Wade and LeBron James, he's a good bet to reach double figures in career All-Star Games, and certainly could add another ring or two to his finger.
 
"I don't think this is his last All-Star Game," said Heat forward Shane Battier. "I think CB has got several more up his sleeve. I think that will put him over the top (and into the Hall of Fame)."
 
Bosh, though, claims he's a lock now. Heck, he figured he was one four years ago when he had just four All-Star Games on his resume.
