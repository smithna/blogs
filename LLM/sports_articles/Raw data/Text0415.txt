Ince has been strongly linked with a return to his former club Liverpool, who have previously seen an offer for the player rejected by Blackpool.

Swansea City have also been mooted as admirers of the England Under-21 international, but now Reading are hoping to steal a march on their rivals.

It is understood that the Premier League strugglers have offered a fee in the region of £7million-£8million for a player who scored twice in Blackpool's win at Wolves on Saturday.

Speaking after the game at Molineux, Blackpool's caretaker manager Steve Thompson confirmed that Ince would not be allowed to leave the club on the cheap.

Thompson said: "I have heard the speculation but everything has a price. You see certain players going for big money and he is just as good as them.

"So if he is going to go, he is not going to go cheap. He is a special talent. If Tom goes, he goes, and he has earned it because he has been fantastic.

"He is still a little baby really and still has a lot to learn. But he has an end product and goals. If someone comes in they will get a special player but we are not going to give special players away for cheap at Blackpool."
