Survive and advance is a popular sports mantra normally saved for the month of March and the madness that comes with it.
  	  
    	But thanks to the rapid growth of the NFL and fantasy football, games like FOX Fantasy Survivor can feed your craving for “win or go home” competition seven months early.
  	Thousands of football fans signed up and participated in the FOX Fantasy Survivor game last season. The hope is, with cash prizes on the line, we can eclipse that mark in 2012.
  	The premise is simple: pick one (1) team who you believe is going to win that week. The survivor catch remains that once you pick a team to win, you can’t pick that team again for the rest of the season.  The good news is, even if you lose, you are still eligible to win cash prizes.
  	To assist you with your survivor selections, the FOXSports.com’s fantasy football staff will provide you their picks for the week.
  	Just remember the mantra: survive and advance. In a month, you could be $2,000 richer.
  	Fowler and Beall - Colts (Andy Luck's remarkable rookie season will continue on into the playoffs.  The quarterback found his favorite target, Reggie Wayne, in the back of the end zone to break a 13-13 tie in the fourth quarter.  But the best news?  Chuck Pagano returns to the sidelines in Week 17 after missing most of the season battling cancer.  Chuck Strong!)
  	Halpin - Patriots (It wasn't a pretty road win for the Patriots.  Jacksonville had plenty of chances, including a late fourth-quarter drive that would have tied things up at 23 and forced overtime, but Chad Henne's third interception of the game locked things up for the Pats as they target homefield in the playoffs.)
  	Harmon - Panthers (Carson Palmer, Terrelle Pryor and Matt Leinart.  THESE are your 2012 Oakland Raiders quarterbacks.  Another loss for the silver and black as Darren McFadden's legacy is quickly becoming one of the big "what-ifs" of all-time.)
  	  
  	This game should wrap up the Norv Turner-era in San Diego.  Last week's game against the Panthers tied a bow on Carson Palmer's season as the quarterback cracked some ribs and was dealt a bruised lung.  As of press time, head coach Dennis Allen was still deciding between starting Matt Leinart or Terrelle Pryor. Ryan Mathews is out with his second broken collarbone of the season.  Gosh, the more you write about these two teams, the more you wonder how they won a combined 10 games this season.  Sloppy for certain, but a San Diego win as Norv leaves the building.
  	Beall - Redskins over Cowboys
  	It's winner-take-all when the Redskins and Cowboys get together in Week 17 as the NFC East division title somehow slipped through the New York Giants' hands.  The last time these two teams played each other, it was Thanksgiving Day and Dallas was without Demarco Murray.  The Cowboys rushed for 35 yards as a team that day, while Tony Romo and RG3 combined for nearly 750 passing yards and seven touchdown passes.  In the end, the rookie won the road test, 38-31.
  	Halpin - Bills over Jets
  	If you watch this game with great interest, you REALLY love football.  Even Tebow Time, a must-watch in 2011, isn't appointment viewing with the way the Jets' mismanaged their quarterback situation in 2012.
  	Harmon - Seahawks over Rams
  	Harmon was schocked, SHOCKED!, to learn Seattle was still in his pro football survivor bullpen this late into the season.  Russell Wilson and company still have an outside chance of winning the NFC West division title and with a lot to play for, expect Pete Carroll to strive for 50 points again.
