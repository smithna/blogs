The team announced Tuesday that it had promoted the longtime front-office executive a little more than a week after the Fever won its first WNBA championship.
 Krauskopf has been Indiana's chief operating officer since 1999 when the team was founded and became the GM in 2004, constructing teams that have made eight straight playoff appearances. Team owner Herb Simon praised Krauskopf for her basketball knowledge.
 She also has helped select the women's Olympic team since 2000 and served as the league's first director of basketball operations before joining the Fever. The Texas A&M graduate also was assistant athletic director for sports at her alma mater and assistant commissioner of the now defunct Southwest Conference.
