DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) --  Chicago Bulls star Derrick Rose participated Monday in five-on-five drills, the latest step in his recovery from a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.
     
 Coach Tom Thibodeau told reporters after practice that Rose "did what everyone else did."
 Rose has been sidelined since he tore his ACL late in last season's playoff-opening win over Philadelphia. The top-seeded Bulls wound up losing that first-round series.
 Rose caused a stir last week when he said he was prepared to miss the whole season rather than return too soon. The Bulls have said that he is on schedule and that they won't rush him back.
 Chicago is second in the Central division at 30-22. The Bulls visit New Orleans on Tuesday.
