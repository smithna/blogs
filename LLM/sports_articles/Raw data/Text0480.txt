After winning his fourth Australian Open and sixth Grand Slam singles title, Novak Djokovic discusses Roland Garros, the only major he has not won. Djokovic, who defeated Andy Murray in the final, hopped on a 3 AM flight to Europe afterward, as he is scheduled to play in Serbia’s Davis Cup tie against Belgium on indoor clay beginning Friday.
  	“In life, you know, you don't get many of the opportunities to win Grand Slams,” he said. “As a tennis player, that's a pinnacle of the ambitions and of the success. So I try to enjoy it for few days with the people I love the most, family, friends, and team. And then after I turn to the rest of the season. It's Davis Cup already coming up. And then after that, there is still four or five months till the French Open. Of course, I want to go all the way in French Open. I went to the finals last year and had a great match against Rafa, but he's always the favorite on that surface and he's the ultimate player to beat on clay. But I think if I continue on playing well, stay healthy, I can have a chance.”
