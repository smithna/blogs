Lou Amundson is heading to the New Orleans Hornets.

The power forward wrote in a text message Monday to FOX Sports Florida that he will sign with the Hornets for the rest of the season after his 10-day contract with the Chicago Bulls expires at the end of the day.
"Chicago was prepared to sign me to another 10-day, but I felt I should go somewhere where I can get a better opportunity to play,'' Amundson wrote in a text message.

Amundson signed a 10-day deal with the Bulls on March 2. But he played just two minutes in one game while not appearing in four others.

The Hornets needed a big body after power forward Jason Smith recently was lost for the season with a shoulder injury.

Amundson, who began the season with Minnesota before being waived Feb. 8, has seven-year NBA career averages of 3.8 points and 3.6 rebounds.
