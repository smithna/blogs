After needing three sets to win her first two matches, the British number one was never in the hunt against an opponent ranked 48 places below her.

Watson was broken six times in total in the quarter-final in Memphis and struggled particularly on her second serve, winning just two of 11 points.

The fourth seed was brushed aside in just 53 minutes by Swiss Voegele, who will next meet New Zealander Marina Erakovic in the semi-finals.

Erakovic - who knocked out defending champion Sofia Arvidsson in the last round - remains on course to go one better than last year's final defeat after recording a 7-4 6-2 triumph over American Jamie Hampton.

In the other half of the draw, third seed Sabine Lisicki saved seven of the eight break points she faced to knock out Kristina Mladenovic of France 6-3 6-3 after one hour and 30 minutes on court.

The German's next opponent will be the seventh-seeded Magdalena Rybarikova, who caused something of a surprise with a 6-7 (9/11) 7-5 6-3 win over top seed Kirsten Flipkens.
