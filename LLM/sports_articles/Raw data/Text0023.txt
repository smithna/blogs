The Cowboys reported the move on their website Saturday night. Dooley will replace Jimmy Robinson, who could stay with Dallas in another capacity.
  	Dooley was fired at Tennessee in November after posting the longest run of consecutive losing seasons at the school in over a century. He was 15-21 in three seasons but just 4-19 in the Southeastern Conference and 0-15 against Top 25 teams.
  	Dallas coach Jason Garrett and Dooley were on the same staff with the Miami Dolphins in 2005-06. Garrett was offensive coordinator, and Dooley coached tight ends. Those are Dooley's only two years of pro experience.
