Djokovic is 4/6 to win the Australian Open after beating Federer in straight sets. Can he do it? Bet now.
 
 Novak Djokovic inflicted another grand slam semi-final defeat on Roger Federer with a straight-sets triumph over the defending champion at the Australian Open.  
 		  			Third seed Djokovic, who also beat Federer at the same stage of the US Open last year, prevailed 7-6 (7/3) 7-5 6-4 in exactly three hours.
After the Serb claimed a tight first set on a tie-break, second seed Federer appeared to have turned the match around when he opened a 5-2 lead in the second.
But the Swiss, a 16-time grand slam winner, then suffered complete meltdown, losing five games in a row to hand Djokovic a two-set lead.
And Djokovic came through a topsy-turvy third set, breaking for 5-4 and serving out victory on his third match point.
The 23-year-old, whose only major title came at Melbourne Park three years ago, awaits the winner of Friday's second semi-final between fifth seed Andy Murray and seventh seed David Ferrer.
Serve dominated during the first set, neither player facing even a break point on the way to an inevitable tie-break.
Djokovic seized the initiative early in the breaker, racing 4-1 ahead before eventually closing it out 7-3 on his second set point.
And he immediately broke at the start of the second set to take total control of proceedings.
That stranglehold did not last long, however, as Federer - who entered the match on a 15-game winning streak and leading the career head-to-head 13-5 - produced some inspired strokeplay during a run of four straight games.
But Federer's purple patch ended as quickly as it had begun; he was broken twice as Djokovic reeled off the next five games to move within a set of the final.
Djokovic remained resolute early in the third set, saving three break points in the third game.
He pounced in the next, breaking the Federer delivery for the fourth time in total to move 2-1 ahead.
Federer did not lie down and accept his fate, breaking back for 4-4 after a marathon game featuring several deuces but then allowed Djokovic off the hook by surrendering his own serve in the next.
That left Djokovic serving for the match and, despite wasting his first two chances, closed out the result on the third attempt.
Federer's defeat leaves him without any of the four grand slam titles for the first time since 2003 and, coupled with top seed Rafael Nadal's loss to Ferrer on Wednesday, means Sunday's final will be the first at a major not to feature either Federer or Nadal for three years.
