But seeing his plaything progress from this FA Cup fourth-round replay to face Middlesbrough at the Riverside on February 27 did not seem like nectar to the billionaire.
                                          Skipper Terry and his deputy Lampard are, apparently, not Abramovichs best buddies of late, but they delivered to help quell the challenge of battling Brentford.
                                          At least Terry has a full season left on his contract. Lampard, now Chelseas record scorer in the FA Cup with 36 goals, looks set to go at the end of this season.
                                          This was not one of Lamps brightest shows. He could have had a hat-trick to take him to within a strike of Bobby Tamblings club best of 202 but was surprisingly out of sorts before the break.
                                          Still, when he went off in the 81st minute, it was to a standing ovation.
                                          Abramovichs hands stayed buried in his pockets. And it was a sunny 10 degrees in west London yesterday!
                                          Similarly, when fans chorused Frankie, we want you to stay after his goal, the tycoons lips remains sealed. Abramovich would make a good poker player.
                                          At least Rafa Benitezs men, the Cup holders, are on a decent run of three straight wins, nine goals scored and just one conceded. 
                                          But this game could have been oh so different if Brentford had enjoyed a bit of fortune.
                                          Chelsea started the brighter. Lampard scuffed a shot into the ground and Oscars follow-up was blocked by Harlee Dean.
                     Then Lampard blazed over and Oscar slipped and miscued his shot on to a post after being put clear by the excellent Mata.
                                          Next came a cruel blow for the Bees in the 40th minute. 
                                          David Luiz tripped Adam Forshaw and referee Neil Swarbrick blew in an instant, not realising the ball had broken free for Marcello Trotta to slot home with his left foot. 
                                          With the Chelsea fans so hard on Benitez it would have been interesting to see how they would have reacted to seeing their team go behind again to Brentford, who led twice at Grifﬁn Park in the 2-2 draw and were just seven minutes off a fabulous giant-killing.
                                          Lampard continued his off-day, sidefooting a right-foot volley wide. Then in the 54th minute Mata showed his team-mate how to ﬁnish.
                     A punt downﬁ eld from goalkeeper Petr Cech was nodded down by Demba Ba and, after a touch to control, the Spaniard drilled in a 20-yard left-foot shot.
                                          As Eden Hazard came on for Victor Moses in the 66th minute, the visitors fans taunted Chelseas £50m striker Fernando Torres on the bench. We want Torres, they sang.
                                          Hazard had an instant impact, releasing Branislav Ivanovic on the overlap to the byline in the 68th minute. 
                                          His pullback found Oscar and his clever backﬂick took a deﬂection and went underneath Simon Moore and through the legs of Dean on the line.
                                          Dean was at fault again in the 72nd minute, diving in to challenge Mata but easily being turned by the super Spaniard. 
                                          He burst down the left and picked out Lampard with a perfect delivery, allowing him to sidefoot home a neat volley.
                                          A minute later Terry made it four, embarrassing Tony Craig at the far post to power in a header from an Oscar cross.
                                          Luiz was lucky to escape a second booking  or even a straight red  in the 84th minute, when he cynically shouldered 19-year-old substitute Jake Reeves off the ball as he burst through the centre of midﬁeld, forcing the Bees to complete the game with 10 men. 
                                          That was nothing to do with the magic of the Cup for sure, but maybe Abramovich enjoyed it!
