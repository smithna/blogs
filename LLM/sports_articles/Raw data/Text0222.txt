An Argentine police officer was in critical condition after being shot during a clash with football hooligans which saw nine people arrested.
  	
   	Judge Alejandra Rodenas told reporters Monday that the violence took place during a confrontation between hooligans supporting Argentine clubs Rosario Central and Newell's Old Boys.
  	Sunday's match between the two rivals at Newell's stadium - a practice game weeks before the regular season resumes - was called off before it started by security officials.
  	Violence is endemic in Argentine football with threats in and out of the stadium accompanying almost every match. The Argentine Football Association made no reference to the violence on its official website.
