   	Bob Costas of NBC touched off a firestorm of reaction from across the country at halftime of Sunday night's Eagles-Cowboys game to speak to the issue of gun culture in America, reading liberally from Jason Whitlock's column on the issue.
  	Tuesday morning, Costas told The Dan Patrick Radio Show that he made a "mistake" in trying to convey his intended points in a brief, 90-second segment on Sunday.
  	“My mistake is I left it open for too much miscommunication,” told Patrick. “Here’s where I stand: I do not want to see the Second Amendment repealed. ... People should be allowed to own guns for their own protection. Obviously, those who are hunters. ... Access to guns is too easy in some cases. I don’t see any reason a citizen should be able to arm himself in some states in ways only police or military should — to have a virtual militia [by] mail order or gun shows. Why do you need a semi-automatic weapon? What possible use is there? ... Whitlock wrote about a gun culture. That’s what I was focusing on.”
  	As the sports world continues to move forward in the wake of this horrible, yet somehow defining event, Whitlock and Costas have gotten together on this podcast to share their insights about the myriad issues related to this tragedy.
