COMPETITION for a place in the team is bringing the best out of Notts Countys top scorer Yoann Arquin.
 		
                    The Frenchman came off the bench to level for the Magpies with his ﬁrst goal since November.
                                          The 24-year-old ﬁ red home from Jamal Campbell-Ryces free-kick to earn his side a point.
                                          Walsall had taken the lead through a Will Grigg penalty after County keeper Bartosz Bialkowski clattered Jamie Paterson.
                                          Arquins team-mate Alan Judge reckons the arrival of two hotshot youngsters from up the divisions has ﬁ red up the Frenchman.
                                          Jacob Blyth arrived this week on-loan from Leicester City and started up front against Walsall.
                                          He formed a strike force with Manchester United loanee John Coﬁ e, who made a scoring debut against Crewe last Saturday.
                                          Arquin is known to the rest of the County squad as Anelka due to his combination of skill and sulkiness. He has found himself on the bench in recent weeks due to a lack of goals but responded with his eighth of the season at the Banks Stadium.
                                         Judge said: Luckily Yoann got a couple of chances and he put one away.
                                          Hes seen all the strikers coming into the team and he knows now hes got to start putting the ball into the back of the net. 
                                          Yoann is a great player, hes just got to get his attitude just right. 
                                          When it is right as it was today he has come off the bench and he ran them ragged. A draw did not help either sides play-off ambitions but was a fair result.
                     The home side dominated the opening 45 minutes before County got their act together.
                                          Judge said: "We couldnt move the ball in the ﬁrst half but Ill never moan about our pitch again. That pitch was a disgrace. 
                                          But you have to deal with the conditions and we didnt do that ﬁrst half. 
                                          In the second half we came out and we went long, we did what they did and it worked.
                                         Theres nothing wrong with being more direct. We cant play our passing game all the time, sometimes were overplaying it.
"                                          Grigg also showed his disappointment with Walsall only getting a point.
                                          He said: "It was a tough game, tough conditions but the lads are gutted with the result and I think that shows how far weve come throughout the season. On another day we could have won.
                                          We created a few chances in the ﬁrst half and maybe could have snuck it, but second half we didnt get going."
