The Pistons have teamed up once again with Meijer to present "Pistons Days at Meijer" - the closest Pistons experience you'll find outside The Palace of Auburn Hills.   Members of various Pistons entertainment groups will visit eight different Meijer locations in Southeastern Michigan during the 2012-13 season. Meijer shoppers will also have a chance to participate in a shooting competition to win free Pistons tickets and receive other great Pistons prizes! 
  To complete the experience, a Pistons player will be there during the final hour of the event to meet fans and sign autographs. Fans can pick up a free autograph card or bring a personal item. To keep the line moving, fans are asked to refrain from requesting multiple autographs or a posed picture.
