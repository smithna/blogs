Roberto Mancinis team have won all of their five games so far this month without even conceding a goal, the latest success catapulting them into the FA Cup fifth round.
                    
                     And it is the fear of letting  the Red Devils extend their five-point lead at the top of the Premier League that has been spurring City on.
                     
                     Midfielder Gareth Barry explained: "That gap at the top between us and United is there, so we cant afford to let that grow any more.
                     
                     We want to end up as Premier League champions again, so that has made all the lads really  knuckle down." 
                     
                     With Yaya Toure going on Africa Cup of Nations duty, it made it a bit tougher but weve really got together as a team and got some great results.
                     
                     In fact, City have now racked up six straight wins on the trot, with the  latest giving them hope of going all the way in the FA Cup once again.
                     
                     They won this competition in 2011, beating Stoke in the final.
                    
                     And victory over the Potters has brought the chance of another visit to Wembley a step nearer.
                     
                     Barry said: "Of course the FA Cup was always a priority, but with us out of Europe its going to be massive for us if we can get to Wembley."
                     
                     That view was echoed by assistant manager David Platt, who said:  "Winning the FA Cup gives you a  belief you can do it again.
                     
                     It certainly gives you the taste that you want to do it again. The hunger is there and its a great feeling.
                     
                     The target of this club is to win trophies, thats what we are set up to do. Its what the manager wants to do. He wants to win everything he is in and its important because when we set off every season we set off to win things.
                     
                     We feel we are involved in both competitions and have the capability of winning both."
                    
                     Citys latest win came courtesy  of one of their most consistent  defenders, Pablo Zabaleta.
                     
                     Barry said: "Zabas had a fantastic season. He always gives 100 per cent and since Ive been here, hes never had a bad game." 
                     
                     He is a fans favourite and this  season is popping up with some  vital goals.
                     
                     Zabaleta and his fellow defenders will have to cope without Vincent Kompany at QPR tomorrow, though.
                     
                     The City skipper limped off after just 33 minutes with a calf injury, which will force Mancini to juggle an already depleted defence. 
                     
                    While City had to reorganise their defence, they were still never  troubled by a woeful Stoke.
                     
                     And it all left dejected Potters  manager Tony Pulis praising the  victors, rather than chastising his own team.
                     
                     He said: "I dont want to be too down or too despondent because of who we were playing against."
