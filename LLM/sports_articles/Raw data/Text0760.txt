JENSON BUTTON slid down the timesheets on the third day of testing at Jerez after another mechanical problem.
 		
On Tuesday the McLaren ace missed five hours track time after his new MP4-28 racer developed a fuel pump problem, but he roared back with the days fastest lap.
                                          However, yesterday he was left stranded out on the track after sacrificing fast laps for aero and mechanical testing.
                                          Buttons day ended five minutes early when he pulled up due to a loose wheel following a pit stop.
                                          Nico Rosberg let Mercedes breathe a huge sigh of relief as he piled on the laps to ease the pain of the two previous nightmare days.
                                          On Tuesday Rosbergs car briefly caught fire after developing an electrical fault, while new team-mate Lewis Hamilton crashed out on Wednesday at 170mph after his rear brakes failed.
                                          But yesterday Rosberg managed 148 laps  the equivalent of two grands prix  and he said: We were just massively unlucky with problems that could have been easily avoided, but theyve also been so difficult to fix, which is also very unusual.
                                          But today we showed we have a very reliable car. We really made up for it.
                                          "Nothing at all went wrong, not the slightest thing, which is good.
                                          British star Hamilton will hope to put in the miles today in testing before the season kicks off in Australia on March 17.
                                          Rosberg was second fastest yesterday, sandwiched between Ferraris Felipe Massa and world champion Sebastian Vettel, who made his first outing in the new Red Bull.
