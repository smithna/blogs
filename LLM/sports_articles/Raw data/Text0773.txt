ARSENE WENGER was close to meltdown as he hit out on the eve of his sides crunch clash with Bayern Munich. 
 		
  The under-fire Arsenal boss lost his cool at the press conference ahead of the Champions League last-16 tie.
                                                               It was the angriest the 63-year-old has appeared in public, lashing out at claims he had been offered a new two-year deal by the struggling Gunners, who were knocked out of the FA Cup by Blackburn on Saturday. 
                                                               Wenger  who has been at the north London club for over 16 years  claimed the report was part of a conspiracy to undermine him and the club.
                                                               He even turned on a journalist yesterday, asking him why he was staring at him as he gave his briefing.
                                                               Why do you look at me? he demanded.
                                                               Turning to the contract claim he added: Why does it just come out when we lose a big game? You think I am so naive that I dont see what is behind that? You think I am a complete idiot?
                                                               I work for 16 years in England and I think I deserve a bit more credit than wrong information that has only one intention  to harm.
                                                               But Wenger refused to elaborate on why he felt the claim of a new contract  his current one expires at the end of next season  had emerged.
                                                               Im more worried about the players, he added. 
                                                               I will go into the Champions League in a different situation.
                                                               On top of that they have to fight against everybody and I want to protect the players to make sure they go into the game in a good condition.
                                                               The lie is targeted to hurt. So I think morally that is wrong. Its easy to say people are not happy and on top of that say hes extending the contract.
                                                               The Champions League represents Arsenals last chance of ending an eight-year trophy drought, after they crashed out of the FA Cup.
                                                              Wenger alleged pundits were jumping on an anti-Arsenal bandwaggon, adding: There is a lot of superficial analysis.
                                                               We have to accept we take the blame for going out, but you have to put things into perspective. Because one guy says one thing, everybody has to go the same way.
                                                               The defeat to Rovers sparked loud booing at The Emirates and  calls for Wenger to be sacked.
                                                               But last night Gunners chairman Peter Hill-Wood turned on Wengers critics and insisted there was no way the club would axe him.
                                                               You have your ups and downs and we are having a bit of a down, he told Starsport.
                                                               But some of the reaction has been a bit hysterical.
                                                               You hear clubs being criticised for sacking their manager too quickly. Now there are people out there calling for us to sack a manager who has been a huge success for 15 years.
                                                               That does not help much. I have been extremely disappointed by some of the recent results.
                                                               I have been an Arsenal fan for a lot longer than most so I think I know what it feels like.
                                                               It hurts a lot and I am sure Arsene is hurting too.
                                                               He is very diplomatic and calm but deep down he feels very strongly and he is as upset as anyone.
                                                              Its not just me who is backing Arsene. (Major shareholder) Stan  Kroenke is very supportive too.
