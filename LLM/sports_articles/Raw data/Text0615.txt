Rockstar Energy Racing Suzuki's Davi Millsaps increased his lead in the AMA/ FIM World Supercross Championship to 21 points with second place at the Dallas, Texas seventh round at the weekend, as team-mate Blake Wharton grabbed second in the opening round of the East Coast Lites series.
 Millsaps holeshotted his RM-Z450 Suzuki in the 20-lap Main Event - watched by a crowd of 55,000 at the Cowboys Stadium in Arlington - and, apart from losing the race lead to defending Champion Ryan Villopoto, rode fast and faultlessly.
 Said Millsaps: "It was a fabulous, wonderful, amazing 20 laps. I won my heat race, then got the holeshot in the Main and got second. I'm very happy about that!"
 Wharton, who was forced to LCQ, went into the Lites Main Event with the second-to-last gate pick. He narrowly missed the holeshot and rode 15 smart laps aboard his RM-Z350 to finish in second position behind Scotland's Dean Wilson.
 Said Wharton: "I've been watching in the west but it's been a while since I've raced. It's always nice to get that first one out of the way. Dallas is nice because I know a lot of people here, but it's Supercross so it's always intense. Practice was a little rough, the heat race was a little rougher. I had to go to the LCQ - no one really ever likes that. I think you lose life when you go to the LCQ. It's not healthy even if you win. I feel like I've aged! Fortunately I won that and I went to the Main with a bad gate pick - well I guess I wouldn't say bad gate - but no one is going to go there with their first choice. I somehow almost got the holeshot so that was pretty good. I just rode a solid 15 laps. I'm going to want to do things different next weekend, but I still want to be up there."
