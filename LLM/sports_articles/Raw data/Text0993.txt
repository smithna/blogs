SUPER-SUB NANI DRIVES MANCHESTER UNITED PAST READING

SUPER-SUB Nani drove Manchester United into the FA Cup quarter-finals - days after being involved in a crash with a police car.

The Portuguese winger hit top gear to shunt gritty Premier League strugglers Reading out of the competition at Old Trafford.

He scored one goal and set up another in the second half of this fifth-round tie to show he had suffered no ill-effects from his crash.

Nani's Bentley Continental was hit on Friday by an unmarked police car responding to an emergency call.

Last night he came on as a replacement for Phil Jones, who injured an ankle in a 40th minute challenge from Jobi McAnuff.

And he gave Reading an immediate sign of things to come by hitting the foot of a post with a 20-yard volley.

Then, in the 69th minute, he took full advantage of a cracking Antonio Valencia cross to fire home a right-footed shot from 12 yards.

Three minutes later he crossed for Javier Hernandez to head United further ahead and put them on course for a home lasteight tie with holders Chelsea or Middlesbrough.

However, Reading threw a late spanner in the works when McAnuff made the most of Chris Smalling's failure to clear a ball in the box in the 81st minute.

The Reading captain took advantage and slipped the ball home to give the visitors hope of claiming a replay, but they couldn't find an equaliser.

United will be concerned by the injury to Jones, one of their outstanding players in the 1-1 Champions League draw with Real Madrid in Spain last week.

He left the ground with his injured ankle in a protective cast and the big question is whether he will be fit enough for the second leg against Real.

In the meantime, United's dream of a second Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup Treble is still on.

But there is no doubting that last night they struggled for long periods against a very determined Reading.

Their boss Brian McDermott showed where his priorities lie by making six changes from his side's last match at Stoke.

The romance of the cup was clearly not on his mind as much as Premier League safety for a team that is currently third from bottom.

United boss Sir Alex Ferguson also fielded a much-changed team, making eight alterations from the team that drew 1-1 in Madrid last week.

Only Jones, David Welbeck and keeper David De Gea started, with Wayne Rooney not even in the squad.

But United, clearly determined to stamp their authority on the game, almost took the lead after only two minutes.

Hernandez had a shot blocked and then Valencia miskicked with the goal at his mercy.

But Reading were far from overawed by the league leaders and attacked at every opportunity.

One really dangerous free-kick from Noel Hunt was headed away after 20 minutes by United skipper Nemanja Vidic. But three Royals' keeper Adam Federici to prevent United from going ahead.

He produced a marvellous double save to deny Tom Cleverley and then Ashley Young, who was later replaced by Robin van Persie as United pushed for the breakthrough.

Australian Federici was in brilliant form, just as he was in the fifth round at Old Trafford five years ago.

On that occasion he made a string of fine saves to secure an FA Cup replay.

But despite all his super stops in this game it was Manchester United's night - thanks to that man Nani.
