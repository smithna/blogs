"I don't mean no disrespect but he (Beckham) is not as scary as when he was playing in the Premier League," he said.
                                          "PSG have a lot of stars, Beckham is the latest, but on the pitch he is not our main concern. It would be naive from us to focus on him."
                                          Barton's image as football's bad-boy is in stark contrast to the good press Beckham regularly enjoys.
                                          But the former Newcastle star says he would have it no other way.
                                          "We are totally opposite characters, Beckham and I. I take it as a compliment."
                                          "Sometimes I'd like to have a bit of positive media comments but I don't envy the intrusions into the private life."
                                          Barton left English football under a cloud last summer, after he was handed a lengthy ban for brawling with a number of Manchester City stars on the last day of the season.
                                          And the 30-year-old knows he will have to be on his best behaviour during the red-hot atmosphere of French football's biggest match.
                                          "I am an experienced player, I know the music. I've played City v United derbies, Sunderland v Newcastle, QPR v Chelsea.
                                          "It's not the easiest. The last time I did not (control my emotions), I got a 12-match ban."
