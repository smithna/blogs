The Seattle Storm will be without three-time league MVP Lauren Jackson for the 2013 season while she stays in Australia to recover from recent hamstring surgery.



The Storm made the roster announcement Wednesday. Her contract has been suspended and she is expected to play for Seattle in the 2014 season.

Jackson underwent surgery last month in Melbourne. She is expected to make a full recovery, but in a statement from the Storm, Jackson said she was not going to be ''fit, ready or confident'' for the WNBA season.

Seattle coach and general manager Brian Agler said he supports Jackson's decision to take the time to let her body heal.

Jackson has not played a full season since 2010, when Seattle won its second league title. In nine games last year after the London Olympics, she averaged a career-low 10.2 points.
