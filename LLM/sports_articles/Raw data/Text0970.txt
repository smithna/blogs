With Arsène Wenger reduced to puddle status in the wake of yesterday's well publicised "MELTDOWN", now is probably a good time for the Fiver to tiptoe around the high viz durable plastic "Caution: Wet Floor" warning sign (complete with a helpful illustration of a Gareth Bale silhouette flinging itself through the air) erected in front of the now dissolved Arsenal manager and see how things are going in the Bayern Munich camp. The Germans performed their obligatory media duties yesterday afternoon too, but with so many folk – including the Fiver – getting in a right old tizzy over Wenger's "MELTDOWN", their thoughts about tonight's Big Cup knockout round first leg have been comparatively ignored.

As anyone who has ever read a Guardian Sport comments section or listened to a radio phone-in show will know, football is a sport followed by the kind of people whose opinions are always carefully considered and well thought-out and never half-baked or laughably knee-jerk. With that in mind, it's no surprise that in the wake of Arsenal's recent reverse against Blackeye Rovers, many people have decided that a side boasting such talents as Santi Cazorla, Theo Walcott and Jack Wilshere stand zero chance against German opponents so ruthlessly invincible they've conceded, on average, a goal a game in this season's Big Cup and have already been spanked by a team from Belarus.

While they go into tonight's match as fairly hot favourites, the Fiver would like to think Jupp Heynckes and his players weren't merely being kind when they rubbished the notion that the outcome is a foregone conclusion. "Both teams have a lot of quality," said Bayern midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, before his manager weighed in with a slightly over the top "if you take away the game against [Blackeye Rovers], it is a positive [season for Arsenal]". While Arsenal's lack of consistency has been their most consistent trait this season, Bayern Munich have been razing all before them this season like a [insert potentially ill-advised historical military simile here], conceding so few Bundesliga goals that their keeper Manuel Neuer has had to pimp his right-hand glove in order to stop him picking his nose from boredom. "I don't have a result I wish for as such, but I think that we can win if we play at our very top level," said Heynckes, ushering his players into a lift and getting Neuer to press the top button with his massive padded finger.

FIVER LETTERS

"Hull City fans are the latest to be subjected to the football equivalent of kettling – our Easter Saturday fixture at Huddersfield can only be attended by away supporters that travel from Hull on designated coaches. This fixture was previously a midday kick-off in order to reduce the mythical chances of disorder (this has all come about because of a bit of a post-match ruck a full nine years – count 'em – ago). But now the Sky TV moguls have spoken and the match is to start at 5.20pm, it's the City fans that get the Bronx cheer. Shameful stuff, I hope the Fiver can help to raise awareness so we can get this silly decision overturned" – Mike Scott.

"Re: a Portsmouth suit's defence of the decision by club administrators to charge Carlisle £20 to park their bus at Fratton Park (yesterday's Quote of the Day). Being a Bolton fan, in years gone by I've had the pleasure of paying around £20-£40 every couple of weeks to watch my team park the bus at various football grounds around the country. Usually to no avail. Although on occasion to great effect. Long live the scrappy 0-1" – Chris Parr.

"Now that the Fiver's bestowing letter prizes again, surely it's time to impose letter penalties for readers who incorrectly predict that their letter will be joined by 1,056 other pedants? I can't be bothered to come up with a suitable penalty, but I suspect that you'll get, say, 1,057 suggestions from eager readers if you publish this letter. Lonely, failed attempts to be one of an imaginary 1,057 shouldn't go unpunished" – Conor Williams.

BITS AND BOBS

England will have the chance to lose 4-2 rather than 4-1 to Germany at the next World Cup with the news that Fifa will use goalline technology in Brazil. "The aim is to use [goalline technology] in order to support the match officials and to install a system in all stadia," hurrahed a Fifa statement, "pending the successful installation, and pre-match referee tests."

José Enrique reckons Liverpool can overcome their first-leg deficit in Big Vase against Zenit St Petersburg. "We have a good chance even though we lost 2-0," he said, before unveiling his masterplan: "We have to keep a clean sheet and then to score as many as we can."

Didier Drogba's former club Shanghai Shenhua have been fined, stripped of their 2003 league title and docked points next season, for fixing the result of a game against Shanxi Guoli on the way to the championship 10 years ago. "The entire city is upset at the punishment. We all belong to Shenhua, no matter whether in past or present, no matter how difficult or how much we have been wronged, we will stand and bear it," chirped Shenhua's main investor, Zhao Jun.

And Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri says he really, really, really, no, honest, really welcomes suggestions on team selection and tactics from club president Silvio Berlusconi. "As always, he put forward his ideas and thoughts, which are sometimes brilliant and well thought out," parroted Allegri.
