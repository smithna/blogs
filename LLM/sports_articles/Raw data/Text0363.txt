KOLO TOURE reckons Manchester City have to win the FA Cup this season to save Roberto Mancini from the sack.
 		
The Italian is feeling the heat after seeing the Blues go backwards at home and abroad this season.
                    
                     The champions trail enemies Manchester United by 12 points at the top of the table and crashed out of the Champions League after finishing bottom of their group.
                     
                     And the billionaires are in serious danger of finishing their campaign without a single piece of silverware.
                     
                     Mancinis last hope is winning the FA Cup for a second time in three years, with his side ­facing a home quarter-final against Championship strugglers Barnsley.
                     
                     Toure knows finishing the season empty-handed would be a disaster and might spell the end for Mancini.
                     
                     When asked if City had to win a trophy to save the Italian boss, Toure said: "Yes, of course."
                     
                     It is very important for the players, for us to win, because that will help the manager to be here for sure.
                    
                     But even for us we dont want to finish a season without winning something. 
                     
                     Thats hard for City now. Weve delivered before and we need to maintain that by winning trophies.
                     
                     For a team like City its difficult to go a season without winning one trophy. For us the FA Cup is really important and the league as well.
                     
                     Toure admits the players own futures are on the line but insists they will keep fighting until the bitter end. Mancinis men face a crunch ­showdown with Chelsea this weekend knowing Rafa Benitezs side are hot on their heels in third place. 
                     
                     He said: "Thats up to the board, to the manager. As players, we are just here to win. When you win the Premier League for the first time you want to keep it. 
                     
                     Its very difficult at the moment but I think the season is not finished.
                     
                     Were looking at the next game, to try and win it. We just need to focus.
                     
                     We are not going to give up now. We will keep going, putting United under pressure until the end of the season."
