SOMERSET CCC will be returning to action at Bath this summer.

Fixtures involving Somerset at Bath have been a tradition for over 100 years but unfortunately the appalling weather during 2012 managed to achieve what only the event of two World Wars had previously accomplished; the cancellation of Somerset’s annual appearance in the city.

This season’s match will see Somerset welcome Yorkshire to The Rec on Thursday, August in the YB40 competition.

The first Bath Cricket Festival took place in 1897. As part of the event Somerset CCC hosted The Gentlemen of Philadelphia at The Recreation Ground. Despite 66 from Richard Palairet the match ended in a draw but the tone was set for what would become a cornerstone of Somerset’s history.

Set against the beautiful backdrop of Bath’s iconic architecture, some of the biggest names in Somerset’s history have taken to the field to do battle. The likes of Gimblett, Botham, Richards, Caddick and Trescothick have all excelled within the glorious surroundings of this city that is steeped in such cultural and historical heritage.
As this is a midweek fixture demand for hospitality packages will be extremely high and availability is limited. Anyone interested in hospitality for this match can contact Sam McIntyre on 01823-425323 or email samm@somersetcountycc.co.uk

Somerset will also be heading south this summer to play a competitive fixture in Cornwall.
As part of the Cornish Cricket Festival 2013, Somerset will play their away fixture against The Unicorns in the YB40 competition at Truro CC on Friday, June 14.

This will be the first time that Somerset CCC have played a match in Cornwall since the two counties met in a T20 challenge match in August 2008. Despite 36 not out from Carl Gazzard that afternoon, the match ended in a draw.
