  	It’s been at least a month since you’ve mentioned The Wire in one of your columns. Are you mad at me?
  	10. There has to be a better solution than sitting Ed Reed for an entire game and stealing $400,000 from him because he executed a textbook hit on a receiver.
  	
   	Roger Goodell can call it a helmet-to-helmet hit. I live in football reality. Reed’s de-cleater on Emmanuel Sanders Sunday night was textbook. It was good football. It’s the way football has been played ever since they invented space helmets for football.
  	I’m not anti-player safety. I get the concussion hysteria. I support efforts to make the game safer. There just has to be a better solution than suspending Reed for a game and taking his paycheck. Ed Reed is a signature NFL player. He’s a Hall of Famer. He’s a superstar. I love to watch him play. He should not be demonized because he’s struggling while trying to stop playing safety the way the position has been played for 40 years.
  	(Editor's note: On Tuesday, the NFL agreed, reducing Reed's punishment to a $50,000 fine without suspension).
  	Why not this?
  	Hockey has a penalty box. Why can’t the NFL? You get flagged for a helmet-to-helmet hit — and if replay confirms it was a helmet-to-helmet hit — you must sit out the next 15 minutes (one quarter) of game action. If it happens in the fourth quarter, the time carries over into the next game. If you get flagged twice in the same game, you sit out 30 minutes (two quarters).
  	If you get four helmet-to-helmet hits in the same season, then you get suspended for a game.
  	To arbitrarily suspend Reed for a game and tie the suspension to a hit that took place in 2010 is absolutely ridiculous and it’s why Roger Goodell is seen as clueless by people who actually played football.
  	9. There’s no more mystery regarding what Jim Harbaugh really thinks about Alex Smith. 
  	All it took was a single terrific performance by second-year QB Colin Kaepernick against an overrated Bears defense for Harbaugh to “Belichick” San Fran’s starting QB. Never mind Smith’s 104 QB rating. Never mind Smith’s three-year, $24-million contract extension. Never mind San Fran nearly qualified for the Super Bowl last season.
  	Harbaugh sees his version of Tom Brady when he looks into the mobile, big-arm eyes of Colin Kaepernick. Bill Belichick benched Drew Bledsoe, a QB with a $100 million contract in 2001, in favor of the “hot hand,” Tom Brady. The difference is Belichick had nine weeks of information on Brady. Mo Lewis’ sideline hit on Bledsoe knocked the QB out for two months.
