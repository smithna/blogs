Thibault was fired by the Connecticut Sun last month after leading them to eight playoff appearances in 10 seasons, including trips to the WNBA Finals in 2004 and 2005.
 Thibault went 206-134 in the regular season with the Sun, earning WNBA coach of the year honors in 2006 and 2008. He needs six victories to pass former Houston Comets coach Van Chancellor to become the winningest coach in league history.
 Before joining the Sun, Thibault was an assistant with the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks.
