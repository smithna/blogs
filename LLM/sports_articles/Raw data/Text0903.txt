Manchester United’s last 16 Champions League tie against Real Madrid at Old Trafford on March 5 could be decided by a supremely talented Portuguese winger - however, it might not be the one you’re thinking of.
Nani’s performance in Monday’s FA Cup win over Reading, coming off the bench to open the scoring before delivering a pinpoint cross for Javier Hernandez, was a reminder of what he is capable of.
The Portuguese was touted as one of the hottest properties in world football when he signed for United from Sporting Lisbon in 2007 aged 20.

Staking his claim: Nani celebrates after a match winning performance against Reading in the FA Cup

But at the age of 26, when many thought he would be tearing Premier League defences wide open like his compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo, Nani remains infuriatingly inconsistent.
His time may already be up. Nani did not even make the squad for United’s first leg trip to Madrid, which finished 1-1, and the impending arrival of Wilfried Zaha suggests his career at Old Trafford could be coming to an end.
If he wants to save it, he must show more of the form he displayed against Reading and less of the underwhelming performances that have seen him start just one league game since September.
The parallels with Ronaldo are hard to ignore. Nani is still like the Ronaldo that arrived at United from Sporting Lisbon – the Ronaldo who never grew up.
The diving, the preening, the lack of end product – Ronaldo curbed all of these to become what would be in any other era the best footballer on the planet.


One trick pony? Nani has failed to live up to his potential at Old Trafford
But Ferguson knows what he still has on his hands with Nani. Speaking after the Reading game, the United manager said: ‘He’s got great talent, we know that. I had a feeling he would win the game for us. You could see he was right on form the moment he came on.
‘He had two great strikes immediately and was a threat to them the whole night.
‘It’s a good addition. If he keeps that form it makes my job more difficult now.’
Whether that praise translates into an increased role in the squad of the Premier League champions elect, or a role in the Madrid game on March 5 remains to be seen, but Nani did not do himself any harm last night.

Standing in the shadows: Nani was billed as the man to step into Cristiano Ronaldo's shoes after his move his Real Madrid
The other player United signed from Portugal at the same time as him, Anderson, has suffered from even more inconsistency, and his purchase must go down as a failure.
It would be harsh to rule Nani the same, and it was Anderson who echoed his manager’s thoughts on the winger’s performance.
‘Everybody knows the quality of Nani,’ the Brazilian said.
‘I know he sometimes does not play but when he does he is important for the team. 
‘He won the game for us and he was very important.’
This match-winning ability harks back to two seasons ago, when he was voted Player’s Player of the Year at Old Trafford after topping the Premier League assist charts with 14 and scored 10 goals in all competitions.

Point to prove: Wilfried Zaha's summer arrival from Crystal Palace could stills see Nani leave Old Trafford
It seemed Nani was finally becoming one of United’s most effective players but he has tailed off, although his cross to set up Hernandez against Reading was a reminder of his ability.
And more performances like the FA Cup win could see him still play a role, perhaps even prolonging his stay, one which could even have ended last summer when a move to Zenit St Petersburg was on the cards.
His lack of consistency is a massive factor in United’s willingness to sell him and the distinction between Nani and Antonio Valencia is clear. 

Flipping hell! Nani has the talent to play at the very top but has consistently frustrated Unite fans
Ferguson has used players like Valencia, Park Ji-sung and John O’Shea –good, consistent players, but not possessing Nani’s ability – to get United over the line in competitions.
Much less has he relied on mercurial talents like Nani, but the Reading performance may have been a timely reminder.
Nani is the flamboyant outcast in a United model of consistent victory, but if he has a hot-streak, there may be one last chance at Old Trafford.
