 		 	One of the NFL’s most progressive franchises when it comes to athletic training is taking its program in another direction.
 
  	A source told FOXSports.com that Jeff Fish will not be retained as the director of athletic performance for the Atlanta Falcons. The decision was made because of "philosophical differences," the source said.
  	A.J. Niebel will be named the new head strength and conditioning coach. He was Atlanta's assistant strength and conditioning coach the past two seasons.
  	Fish joined the Falcons in 2008 after spending four seasons as strength and conditioning coach for the Oakland Raiders. Fish’s biography on Atlanta’s web site described his position as “directing all aspects of Falcons physical development, injury prevention, rehabilitation and nutrition, among other responsibilities.”
  	The Falcons have made heavy investments in their training program under head coach Mike Smith and general manager Thomas Dimitroff.
  	Fish’s dismissal came following Atlanta’s 28-24 home loss to San Francisco in the NFC Championship game.
