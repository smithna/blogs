DEMBA BA signed for Chelsea to win trophies – and claims the FA Cup will do now that the Blues have failed on four other fronts.

But the ambitious Senegal striker is already thinking a whole lot bigger than that ahead of today’s Fourth-Round replay with Brentford.

He wants to win the Premier League AND the Champions League with Chelsea – and sees no reason why it can’t happen.

Ba, 27, said: “I haven’t won any trophies so far. I would like to see how it feels to win a trophy. I want to win the league and the Champions League as well. Chelsea won it last season, so why not do it again?”

Chelsea have already missed out on four trophies this season after losing in the Super Cup and Club World Cup finals.

They also became the first holders to crash out in the Champions League group stage before Ba even arrived – and then lost to Swansea in the Capital One Cup semi-finals. But Ba – who could play in a face-mask against Brentford today after breaking his nose – ­insists he will do everything he can to turn things around.

He said: “I gave everything to be where I am today. I just do my job and for a striker, the job is to help the team to win games by scoring goals first of all. 

“It’s not only about scoring goals but it helps the team when you do.”
