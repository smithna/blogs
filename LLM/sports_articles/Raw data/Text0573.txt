ANTWERP, Belgium (AP)  Australian Open winner Kim Clijsters came from behind to beat Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-7 (10), 6-2, 6-1 Sunday and lead Belgium to a 4-1 win over the United States and a place in the semifinals of the Fed Cup World Group.
After Clijsters gave Belgium an insurmountable advantage, Yanina Wickmayer defeated Melanie Oudin 6-2, 6-0 for a 4-0 lead. The U.S. team secured its only point when Liezel Huber and Vania King beat Kirsten Flipkens and An-Sophie Mestach 6-3, 7-5 in doubles.
Mattek-Sands gave the U.S. team its first set of the weekend when she outlasted Clijsters in the tiebreaker, but the second-ranked Belgian easily dominated the No. 48 from then on.
``It really feels good to see that 3-0 on the board so soon,'' Clijsters said.
It is the first time in Fed Cup competition that the Americans have lost two ties in a row, after being defeated by Italy in last year's final. Belgium will play the Czech Republic in Charleroi on April 16-17 for a place in the final.
After Mattek-Sands lost to Wickmayer on Saturday, with unforced errors costing her throughout, the American was aggressive and precise from the start Sunday. She served for the set at 5-4, but let Clijsters back in for the tiebreaker. Despite the noise from the 10,000 fans at Sports Palace, she didn't crumble in a tiebreaker in which both players had great trouble winning points on serve.
``Against top players, she can play a great game,'' Clijsters said. ``I was just hoping she would not keep it up.''
Losing the first set roused the fighter in Clijsters, and she then took charge, never giving Mattek-Sands a chance in a speedy, high-quality second set.
In the decider, Clijsters immediately broke and continued pressing as errors slipped back in Mattek-Sands' game.
Clijsters had beaten Oudin on Saturday while Wickmayer defeated Mattek-Sands to put Belgium in an ideal position ahead of the final day.
