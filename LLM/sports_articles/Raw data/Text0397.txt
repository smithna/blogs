BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER has warned Arsenal to stop pining for the glory days of their past.
 		
  Schweinsteigers Bayern Munich visit The Emirates tonight aiming to heap more misery on the long-suffering Gunners fans.
                                                               Arsenals last chance of a trophy is the Champions League and failure to beat the Germans will see Arsene Wengers men make it eight years without silverware.
                                                               Schweinsteiger plans to keep it that way  because Bayern have unfi nished business in Europe.
                                                               They lost in last seasons final to Chelsea in their own back yard and are determined to go all the way this time at Wembley in May. 
                                                               Schweinsteiger said: "Arsenal are a big club. They are among the top 10 teams in Europe.
                                                               The days of Thierry Henry and Tony Adams are gone. Maybe they are pining for those days.
                                                               They have good players like Jack Wilshere. Hes very dynamic with a good left foot and good vision.
                                                               I dont know why they havent won anything in so long. They have the capability to do that.
                                                               We have lost in two Champions League finals so the motivation for us is huge. We lost to Chelsea last season and a defeat like that you just cant forget. You have to try and deal with it. 
                                                               We have patience and an inner calm, and I do believe we can get through."
                                                               Bayern boss Jupp Heynckes reckons its easy to see why Arsenal are in the middle of a trophy drought  because they are now a selling club.
                                          But he is a big fan of Arsene Wenger and insists you cannot blame the Frenchman for the decline.
                                                               Heynckes said: "Arsenal are competing with Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City. Over the years they have been selling their best players and these other teams get in top world stars, so I dont think it is fair to blame Arsene Wenger for that.
                                                               Arsenal are a good team especially going into attack. If we play to our top level we can win here.
                                                               Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer has only conceded seven goals in the Bundesliga all season."
                                                               German No.1 Neuer, who will play in special gloves because of a hand injury, said: "I suppose you could say its boring being in goal for Bayern. But actually its important to communicate with your defenders."
