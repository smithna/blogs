World Cup leader Tina Maze demonstrated that she had already got to grips with the course in Meribel as she topped the timesheets in downhill training on Thursday.
Maze topped the standings with a time of one minute 16.43 seconds in training as she looked incredibly comfortable on the piste.
Lotte Smiseth Sejersted was just 0.13 seconds slower in second, with Spain’s Carolina Ruiz Castillo 0.3 seconds off the pace.
Local favourite and world champion Marion Rolland, who is among the favourites for Saturday’s race, finished 12th, 1.69 seconds behind.
"The conditions today were really good. Skiing with such a beautiful weather and on a home soil is just great," Rolland said.
"The course is quite turny and wasn’t very fast today because of the snow. We expect it to get harder over the following days and then we will be faster for sure."
The women will get a second opportunity to adapt to the “Roc de Fer” on Friday, ahead of the race on Saturday.
