Michael Thompson claimed the first PGA title of his career after winning the Honda Classic Sunday.
The 27-year-old scooped the top prize of $1,026,000 at Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, to see off Australia's Geoff Ogilvy by two shots.
U.S. star Thompson, who was born in Tucson, Arizona, held his nerve to finish on nine-under for the tournament following a final round 69.
Thompson needed to score par on the final hole, but he produced a birdie just to make sure of top spot and secure 11th place in the FedEx table.

Luke Guthrie of the U.S. took third place after finishing on five-under to seal an impressive performance.
England's David Lynn finished tied for fourth on three-under alongside Lucas Glover, Erik Compton, Keegan Bradley and Justin Rose.
England's Lee Westwood finished on two-under after a disappointing final round of 74, leaving him alongside South Africa's Charl Schwartzel and Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell.
Meanwhile, Tiger Woods could only manage a disappointing four-over 74 as he failed to break par once all week.
"I just made too many penalties this week. Today is a perfect example, I didn't play that poorly. I had two water balls and a lost ball," he told reporters.
"Take those away, and I missed two short birdie putts, and it was actually a decent score. So I've just got to clean up my rounds."
