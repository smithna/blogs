Lofton, who was an unrestricted free agent, started all 16 games at middle linebacker for the Falcons last season. Jonathan Vilma is the Saints' current starting linebacker and defensive captain, but Lofton also has the ability to play other linebacker spots.
  	''Curtis is a versatile, hard-working player that has displayed a knack for being around the football, and more importantly, making plays on the ball,'' Saints general manager Mickey Loomis said Saturday night in a release. ''He has the ability to play all three linebacker positions and we feel that he's just entering the prime of his career. We think he can come to New Orleans and fit in well and provide us with a significant contribution to our defense.''
  	Wheeler, 27, had 84 tackles, one sack and a forced fumble in 11 starts last season. He's a 6-foot-2, 240-pound former Colts third-round draft pick from Georgia Tech.
