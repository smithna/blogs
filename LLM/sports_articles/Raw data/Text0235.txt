After winning last year's Australian Open, Djokovic had the most ranking points - 2,000 - to lose. But the four-set win guaranteed he'd maintain the same points gap over Australian Open semifinalist Roger Federer at No. 2, and third-ranked Murray.
  	The only change in the top five is that Australian Open semifinalist David Ferrer will move from fifth to fourth, shifting the injured Rafael Nadal, who did not play in Melbourne, to fifth place.
  	Unseeded Jeremy Chardy of France, who advanced to the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park this year after losing in the first round in 2012, is expected to move into the top 25 from 36th.
