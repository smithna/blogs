 		 	Chip Ganassi continued to make magic — and history — at Daytona International Speedway on Sunday.
  	Juan Pablo Montoya held off Max Angelelli to deliver Ganassi a record-breaking fifth Rolex 24 at Daytona victory. The Chip Ganassi Racing team’s accomplishment also enabled Scott Pruett to secure his fifth overall Rolex win to tie the record held by Hurley Haywood. The victory is also Pruett’s fifth in the Daytona Prototype (DP) Class, his fourth with Ganassi and his 10th career victory among all classes.

   	“It’s unbelievable,” Pruett said. “When you look at what we’ve been able to achieve, it’s been nothing short of incredible. . . . To win with these guys, to win with Chip, with Telmex, with BMW, and then at the end of it, having gotten to know Hurley real well over the years by racing with him and just as a friend, and to have him there at the end was pretty special, very special thing.”
  	Ganassi was humbled by last year’s Rolex 24, when neither of his teams made podium appearances as Ford swept the top three spots in the DP class. That forced the organization to go to work. Ganassi acknowledged “it was a big effort” for the company.
  	“There are lots of things on these cars,” Ganassi said. “These are not spec cars. These are cars you can make changes with, whether on the wing, the toes, the brakes, the shocks, lots of things you can work with on these cars that really helps you develop mechanical grip. And I think that’s what we worked most on.
  	“We wanted to give those guys every opportunity to win, as well, and we thought the 02 car was obviously very strong . . . so we thought we had two good shots at it here, and we did until earlier today.”
  	With the performance of the BMWs, it was clear from a power standpoint that Ganassi had the field covered. Although the No. 01 developed brake issues just before noon, when Ganassi’s No. 02 car developed mechanical issues and stopped on the course, the caution enabled the No. 01 team to fix the problem.
  	Montoya relieved Pruett at 1:43 p.m. ET for the final stint and took the lead from Marcos Ambrose three minutes later, when the defending championship car pitted and changed drivers with AJ Allmendinger taking the wheel.
  	On a caution for debris with just more than an hour remaining, Allmendinger took the lead out of the pits with Montoya, Joao Barbosa, Max Angelelli and Ricky Taylor rounding out the top five at 2:20 p.m. Six minutes and four laps later, Montoya took back the lead. He held the point for six additional minutes before a caution flag for debris only delayed the inevitable if Montoya’s car stayed intact.
  	When action resumed at 2:41 p.m., Angelelli led Montoya to the restart, and Barbosa forced Allmendinger off the course and received a penalty for avoidable contact. Allmendinger took the opportunity to top off his Michael Shank Racing Ford and cycled out to fourth behind Angelelli, Barbosa and Montoya. Barbosa finally pitted at 2:48 p.m. and served his one-minute penalty, allowing Allmendinger to advance to third.
