After winning four races Sunday, Ortiz equaled his career-best performance. Ortiz has combined with brother Jose on a 30-for-54 hot streak the past week at Aqueduct.
  	The Winkfield was among the most dominant triumphs for Ortiz. Never worse than second, Clawback pulled clear in the lane for his second win in four starts for trainer Rick Violette. The time was 1 minute, 9.75 seconds for the six furlongs.
  	Clawback paid $2.90 for a $2 win bet. Winning Cause overcame a stumble at the start to get second. Rubysandpearls was third.
