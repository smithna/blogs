In the final game of the triple-header with Melbourne, it was the Kangaroos who trimphed by five points, 7.6 (48) to 6.8 (44).
It took a Aaron Black goal with 40 second on the clock to put the Kangaroos in front and Shane Edwards had a chance to win it for Richmond but his shot sailed wide and missed everything.
    	 	
 The Tigers, having backed up from their win over Melbourne in the second game, came out strong in the final game of the night and looked to be heading for an unlikely win before the North Melborne comeback.
The Kangaroos join Collingwood as the only other undefeated team with two more round-robin clashes to come.

 		Majak Daw provided the highlight of the night, taking the ball just outside the 50m arc he jinked around Tigers defender Steven Morris with a strong fend before running in and slotting a classy goal.
It was a big night for the AFL's first Sudanese-born player and will go a long way to him securing an AFL debut in round one.
Kangaroos coach Brad Scott was pleased with his big-man's effort but tempered expectations.
"He's in contention, but I think Daniel Currie was a terrific story tonight. He's one of a number of players we've got who play (Daw's) position,'' Scott said.
Richmond were well served by their leaders, Trent Cotchin, Brett Deledio and Dustin Martin, were all strong during the second game.
Tigers coach Damien Hardwick was pleased with his players effort, despite the narrow loss.
"Our intensity, our ability to tackle and cause turnovers was outstanding,'' he said.
Earlier, the Tigers inflicted a second-straight defeat on Melbourne, after the Demons had lost to North Melbourne in the opener at Etihad Stadium.
The fresh Tigers took advantage of Melbourne backing up after the first game to register a scrappy 15-point win, 1.2.9 (30) to 2.2 (14).
    	 	
The Tigers burst out of the blocks, Cotchin starting brightly as his side dominated the midfield and had eight scoring shots to the Demons' one in the first half.
Riewoldt and Vickery each kicked a first-half goal, while running defender Bachar Houli, who had a strong game, booted a nine-point super goal.
Small defender Steven Morris was also good for the Tigers, blanketing Aaron Davey and winning plenty of the ball.
But he gave Melbourne their only goal of the first half, giving away a free kick and 50m penalty to put Jack Watts in range to goal.
Watts, who played in defence, was among the Demons' best and had a big hand in Richmond not kicking further clear in the second half.
Melbourne draftee Jimmy Toumpas had an impressive debut, with eight touches and a goal, while reigning best-and-fairest winner Nathan Jones was good for the Demons in both of their matches.

In the opening game, Majak Daw showed glimpses of his exciting athletic potential in the Kangaroos two-point win.
Both teams showed off new faces but it was the Kangaroos who prevailed 1.4.5 (38) to 0.5.6 (36).
While Daw, elevated to North's main list at the end of last season after three years as a rookie, didn't do a lot, what he did do stood out.
The powerful 195cm forward-ruckman took a strong pack mark in defence midway through the first half.
Soon after he produced a nice ruck tap from a boundary throw-in to set up a nine-point super goal for ex-Port Adelaide recruit Ben Jacobs.
It was a bright start in Kangaroos colours for Jacobs, who had set up North's first goal with a kick into attack which allowed Lindsay Thomas to take a high-leaping mark over Demons recruit David Rodan.
Another Melbourne recruit, Shannon Byrnes, was involved in letting in the opposition for a goal later in the half, being run down by Kangaroos veteran Brent Harvey, with the turnover setting up Lachie Hansen to mark and goal.
There were a few good signs for the Demons.
Big-leaping Jeremy Howe kicked two second-half goals from marks, to tighten the contest after the Kangaroos threatened to run away with it.
The Demons would have been thrilled to see hulking 18-year-old Jesse Hogan use his body cleverly to mark late in the first half, then thread through a goal from the pocket.
The only problem is they'll have to wait more than a year to watch him do something similar in a game for premiership points, as the under-aged recruit is only allowed to participate in the pre-season this year.
Nathan Jones continued his best-and-fairest form from last season, while midfield father-son recruit Jack Viney had some good moments, but ex-Collingwood key forward Chris Dawes had a quiet start in Demons colours.
Captain Andrew Swallow was North's best player.
