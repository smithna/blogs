With the first day of testing there is so much excitement within the team.
                     
                     But for us the excitement was very shortlived, doing three laps this morning and having the fuel-pump issue.
                     
                     Its never what you want at the start of a test, but its better to have it at the start than at the end so we can solve the issue.
                     
                     When I went out this afternoon I was eventually able to do some runs on different tyres to get a feel for the car.
                     
                     In terms of that, its a nice starting point but not the mileage we obviously hoped for.
                     
                     So it wasnt the best. Today wasnt the perfect day with the issues and there is still a lot of work for us to do before we get this car in a position where were happy with it. As for whether its a championship-winning car, who knows? The important thing is, theres a nice feeling with the car.
                    
                     After finishing eight-tenths of a second up on Webber, 33-year-old Button joked: "I dont know how I did it  I think I cut the chicane!
                     
                     I was surprised when I saw the dash, but the time doesnt mean anything."
                     
                     Lap times mean nothing right now and they wont mean anything at the last test.
                     
                     Its all about the first race when we will have a very different car then, as every team will, and thats when we need to show how quick we are.
                     
                     Lewis Hamilton will give his new Mercedes racer a first serious test run today.
                     
                     And he will hoping he has a better time than team-mate Nico Rosberg, who had to abandon the first day of testing after just 14 laps with flames licking out of the back of his car. Rosberg set the early pace before the W04  only unveiled on Monday  caught fire and broke down.
                    
                     After signing a three-year contract with Mercedes, who have won just one race in three seasons on their return to F1, Hamilton will drive the car for the first time today.
                     
                     He will have been cheered up by Rosberg insisting the car is a big improvement on the one he drove last year which gave him a win in China before a long decline over the rest of the season.
                     
                     "I can guarantee you it will be a big step forward, but of course everybody else is also moving forward and were hoping that weve closed the gap, said Rosberg.
                     
                     I cant say if the car was quick or not, but feeling-wise I was very comfortable. I could push, the balance was okay, and it was enjoyable to drive."
