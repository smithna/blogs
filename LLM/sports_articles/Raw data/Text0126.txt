The Los Angeles Sparks signed guard Kristi Toliver to a multi-year deal coming off a season in which she was chosen the WNBA's most improved player.

The contract was announced Wednesday.

Toliver has averaged 12.4 points, 3.0 assists and 2.5 rebounds in three seasons with the Sparks. She won the league's award after posting team and career-highs in points (17.5), assists (4.9), rebounds (3.2) and minutes (31.5) while starting 33 of 34 games last season.

She also had career-highs in steals (1.3) and field-goal percentage (.491) and was named to the All-WNBA second team while helping the Sparks return to the playoffs.

Toliver has improved in points and steals every year since joining the league in 2009.
