The Citroen driver, competing in the first of only four races this season after going into semi-retirement, won ahead of countryman Sebastien Ogier and Daniel Sordo of Spain after race organizers cancelled the day's final two stages on safety grounds.
  	Adverse weather forced some spectators to attempt to abandon the mountainous terrain ahead of the last two stages, causing major congestion.
  	Loeb, who clinched the day's third stage ahead of Ogier and Sordo, finished 1 minute, 39.9 seconds ahead of Ogier and 3:49 of Sordo overall.
  	The 38-year-old Loeb won't secure a 10th consecutive world title because he'll race only also in Sweden, Argentina and France this year.
