 		 	Robert Griffin III, nursing a knee sprain, will not start at quarterback for the Washington Redskins on Sunday at Cleveland — giving way to fellow rookie Kirk Cousins, FOXSports.com has learned.
  	
   	Griffin, who was listed as questionable all week, suffered a Grade 1 LCL sprain when he was hit by defensive tackle Haloti Ngata late in last week’s 31-28 overtime victory over the Baltimore Ravens.
  	As FOX Sports reported on Friday, Cousins took snaps with the first team all week. Griffin, the league's top-rated passer, took part in individual drills while the media were on hand, but then was shut down when reporters left.
  	Shortly after the announcement Saturday night Griffin tweeted: "The decision was not my own... But I will be there for my team!!! In every way I possibly can."
  	It will be the first missed start for the 22-year-old former Heisman Trophy winner out of Baylor. Griffin, the No. 2 pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, has thrown for 18 scores this season and rushed for six more.
  	The Redskins, 7-6, have won four in a row and enter Week 15 one game out of an NFC wild-card spot. The Browns are 5-8.
  	Cousins, a fourth-round pick out of Michigan State, finished last week's game after Griffin was injured. He threw a touchdown pass in the final minute and ran in the game-tying 2-point conversion. He has appeared in two games this season, completing 7 of 11 passes for 137 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions
