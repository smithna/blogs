The $70 million, 10-year naming rights agreement for the Home Depot Center expires in May, and a spokeswoman for the home improvement company tells The Associated Press it will not be renewing the deal. A message was left Thursday seeking comment from the Anschutz Entertainment Group, which owns the Galaxy.
  	The 125-acre Home Depot Center includes facilities for tennis, track and field, baseball, basketball and other sports. It's also an official training site for U.S. Olympians.
