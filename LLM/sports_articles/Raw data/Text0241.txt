BEIRUT: Riyadi  Beirut continued their rise in the Lebanese Basketball League with a 94-73 victory over Amchit Friday, for their fourth win on the bounce. The match marked the first appearance for Amchit head coach, Italian Lino Lardo, but he was powerless in preventing his side from another loss.
    The Jbeil  team missed three of their key players – Croatian center Dalibor Bagaric, Ghaleb Reda and Anthony Yamine  – and their absence was felt from the beginning as Riyadi led 15-8 in the first quarter.
    Riyadi had an incredible percentage from beyond the arch in the opening minutes, as they sunk six 3-pointers, including three for Omar Turk, to steal a commanding 13-point lead going into the second, 28-15.
    Shooting guard Turk, 32 years old, who began the match as a starter, scored 11 points in the first quarter.
    Coming off the bench, Ahmad Ibrahim  continued to run the show for Riyadi as he scored two consecutive 3-pointers to keep them in control.
    League top scorer Andre Emmett  was certainly in the wars for Amchit as his side never looked in the contest.
    Ismail Ahmad continued his side’s dominance in the second quarter as he helped build on Riyadi’s advantage. The Egyptian star would eventually end the match with a double-double 10 points and 12 assists, along with seven rebounds.
    With a 53-32 halftime scoreline it looked as though Riyadi were on course for a routine fourth straight win.
    Things didn’t change much in the third with Riyadi keeping their upper hand, but despite Amchit edging the quarter 20-18, the hosts led 71-52 heading into the final period.
    The visitors started better early on in the fourth, but they were denied quickly with two back-to-back 3-pointers through Turk and Wael Arakji.
    Despite a poor first half from his side, Emmett clearly wanted to leave his mark on the game. He registered a game-high 32 but, despite that, Amchit ultimately fell short.
    The match ended 94-73, as Riyadi improved their record to 11-2 in second place. While, Amchit were dealt with their fourth successive loss at 8-6 in fifth place.
    Turk top scored for the winners with 22 points, while Abdelnour added 19 points and six rebounds, and Ibrahim contributed with 17 points.
    Alongside Emmett, Matt Freije  and Sabah Khoury  scored 14 and 13 points respectively for Amchit.
    Elsewhere, Byblos  travel to Sagesse  Saturday, knowing they will face a battle in their round 15 tie at Ghazir.
    In their previous match, Sagesse needed double overtime to overcome Byblos away from home, 123-115.
    Sagesse are currently in pole position with a 12-2 record and have been unbeaten at home thus far this season.
    Meanwhile, Byblos are currently in sixth place at 8-5 after the team were dealt another heartbreaking loss against Champville  after overtime 93-86 midweek.
    Although the Jbeil side haven’t been able to beat the top three teams yet, four of their five losses came after being ahead.
    On Sunday, Champville look to extend their winning streak to eight when they host Tripoli  side Mouttahed at Dik al-Mehdi.
    The defending champions will also aim to avenge their first leg loss 81-73, having been unbeaten in seven games.
    They currently sit in third place with 10-4.
    Mouttahed sit in fourth place at 9-5 as they haven’t played a match in almost two weeks.
    In the weekend’s only other fixture, Anibal host Bejjeh  Saturday.
