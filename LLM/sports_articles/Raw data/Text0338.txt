CALLUM McMNERVE ANAMAN helped put the Latics into the FA Cup last eight with a nerveless display thanks to Roberto Martinez and his mind games.
 		
Forget the Road to Wigan Pier, its the road to Wembley for the Premier League strugglers.
                                          Wigan sauntered into the quarter-ﬁ nals for the ﬁ rst time in 26 years as new Town and ex-Coventry boss Mark Robins was dumped out of the cup for the second time in just over a month.
                                          But boss Martinez is ready to write another chapter in the towns rich history, with one more win sealing an FA Cup semi-ﬁ nal spot at Wembley.
                                          The Latics face a sixth-round trip to Everton or Oldham after a McManaman inspired victory and Martinez said: "We made a few changes and I was proud of the players. 
                                          Callum gets so nervous before games I told him he wasnt playing the day before, so he wouldnt be upset overnight and could concentrate on having a good nights sleep. When he ﬁnally found out he was playing, he was delighted.
                                          Its a real joy to see him play, hes an old-style winger who loves taking on the full-back and he was outstanding for us. Youd pay to watch him play.
                                          Its a great tie for us to look forward to in the sixth round, whoever we end up facing. Oldham have been magniﬁcent so well follow the replay with interest."
                                          The only shock on a day to forget for Robins was that it took Wigan more than half an hour to assert their authority with the ﬁrst goal.
                                          Refreshed by a break in Tenerife, they played Huddersﬁeld off the pitch.
                     James McArthurs measured through ball cut out Jack Hunt to ﬁnd McManaman bearing down on goal inside the area and the winger calmly cut inside to beat keeper Alex Smithies six yards out from a narrow angle for his second goal of the season.
                                          The 21-year-old Scouser is yet to make a league start this season but on this show he could be worth his weight in gold to Wigans hopes of beating the drop. Arouna Kone doubled the lead on 40 minutes with Huddersﬁeld in more defensive disarray. 
                                          Not for the ﬁrst time Hunt was left for dead by McManaman, who cut the ball back for Jordi Gomez to see his shot saved by Smithies and Kone followed up to tap in.
                                          Town showed signs of life after the break, throwing on James Vaughan and Lee Novak for Alan Lee and Chris Atkinson.
                                          McArthur rounded off a man-of-the-match display by crashing home the third with an arrow-straight angled drive into the top corner from 15 yards.
                                          Novaks header from a Calum Woods cross found the net just after the hour to pull one back but Kone sealed the win a minute from the end, pouncing on another defensive mix-up to leave Peter Clarke and Anthony Gerrard trailing as he powered home the fourth from 10 yards.
                                          Robins, who went out with Coventry at Spurs in round three, now faces tomorrows Championship trip to Nottingham Forest. 
                                          He said: "We made more of an impression in the second-half but wed given ourselves too much to do by then because Wigan caused us a lot of problems."
