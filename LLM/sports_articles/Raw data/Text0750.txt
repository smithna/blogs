Last night Kevin Garnett announced that the 2013 All-Star Game in Houston will be his last. For nearly a decade Garnett, the “Big Ticket” has been playing with levels of intensity, competitiveness, and a gumption to win that few players in NBA history can claim to match.
 Garnett was never concerned with making friends in his pursuit of a NBA Championship. After only being able to come within a win of the reaching the NBA Finals with the Minnesota Timberwolves Garnett was saved from early playoff exits and bitter disappointments when he was traded to the Boston Celtics.
 Although Garnett has not officially announced his retirement it can be safely presumed that this season may be his last. But when that day comes which franchise will hang his jersey from their rafters? Minnesota Timberwolves? Boston Celtics? During his time in Minnesota Garnett won a MVP, set a number of franchise records, 2-time defensive player of the year and was an eight-time All-Star. However, in his short stint with Celtics he restored a franchise mired in mediocrity by helping to bring a NBA Championship to a city that had become accustomed with disappointment.
 
Mone/AP Has his short stint with the Celtics overshadowed the dominance that he displayed as the alpha dog with the Timberwolves? Never one to be concerned with accolades and awards Garnett will be truly missed and as NBA scouts and personnel continue to search for the next Garnett, the unemployment line of ex-NBA general managers who have failed will continue to grow. The reality is that Garnett was a once in a generation athlete that may be imitated but never duplicated or replicated because there is and never will be another one quite like him. The Garnett farewell tour starts in Houston during All-Star weekend the country boy from South Carolina has shown certainly shown us that anything is possible.
