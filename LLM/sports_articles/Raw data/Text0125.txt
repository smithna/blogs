Defending WNBA scoring leader Angel McCoughtry has re-signed with the Atlanta Dream.

McCoughtry averaged 21.4 points per game and also led the league with 2.5 steals per game last season. She has played with Atlanta in each of her four seasons and also was a member of the 2012 U.S. Olympic gold medal team.

Terms for the multiyear deal were not announced Thursday.

McCoughtry was suspended for undisclosed violations of team rules last season as the Dream found turmoil after appearing in back-to-back WNBA finals in 2010-11. Coach and general manager Marynell Meadors was replaced with Fred Williams.

McCoughtry was rookie of the year in 2009. Her career average of 19.0 points per game is fifth-best in league history.
