 		 	Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan’s search for a new general manager has come to an end.
  	
 	Who's fired and hired? Check in here for all the NFL head-coaching moves.
 
   	Atlanta Falcons director of player personnel David Caldwell has been tabbed to succeed former Jags general manager Gene Smith, FOX Sports.com has learned. The Associated Press confirmed the move later Tuesday.
  	Caldwell, who also interviewed with the New York Jets since the regular season ended, informed Woody Johnson and Co. on Tuesday that he was negotiating a deal with Jacksonville.
  	Khan fired Smith on Dec. 31 after four disappointing seasons without a postseason appearance.
  	Caldwell is now expected to make a decision on coach Mike Mularkey, AP reported. Mularkey went 2-14 in his first season in Jacksonville and has lost 20 of his past 23 games as a head coach.
  	Khan gave Mularkey's assistants permission to search for other jobs last week, an indication that he doesn't expect to retain Mularkey or his staff.
  	Then again, Caldwell and Mularkey have a relationship stemming from their time in Atlanta.
  	Before becoming the Falcons' director of player personnel in 2012, Caldwell spent four seasons as Atlanta's director of college scouting — the same four years Mularkey served as offensive coordinator. Caldwell replaced Les Snead, who was hired as St. Louis' general manager last offseason.
  	
  	''He's a great guy, a great family man, does a good job,'' Mularkey said of Caldwell last month. ''He had some experience in Indy before he got to Atlanta, and I thought he did a good job up there. ... I thought that (he would become a GM) when I worked with him, that he was heading in that direction.''
  	Caldwell was part of an Atlanta front office that drafted quarterback Matt Ryan, linebackers Curtis Lofton and Sean Witherspoon, offensive tackle Sam Baker, safety William Moore, receiver Julio Jones and running back Jacquizz Rodgers.
  	He doesn't inherit as much talent in Jacksonville, but the Jaguars have the No. 2 pick in April's draft and plenty of room under the salary cap to make moves. And coming off the worst season in franchise history, it won't take much to show improvement.
