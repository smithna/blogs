  (CNN) -- A memorable women's final at the 2011 Australian Open pitted third seed Kim Clijsters against Li Na of China at Melbourne Park's Rod Laver Arena.
 Ninth seed Li had the opportunity to create history and become the first Asian player to claim a grand slam singles title, while Belgium's Clijsters had her eyes on a second-successive major victory.
 It looked as if Li might indeed take her place in the tennis record books as she claimed the opening set 6-3, but three-time U.S. Open champion Clijsters pulled herself level when she won the second set by the same score.
 The 27-year-old Clijsters eventually emerged victorious as she secured a 3-6 6-3 6-3 success after two hours five minutes. 
 It was the first grand slam the former world number one had won outside of the United States and Clijsters shed tears of joy after her triumph.
