He may have flopped at Wembley last month but Brazil forward Neymar is still in demand - and Manchester City are ready to move for the Santos ace.

According to the Daily Mail: "City’s top two executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain are said to have held initial talks with Neymar’s family and his representatives in a box at Wembley on the night of England’s friendly against Brazil on February 6.
"The pair went to the trouble of visiting the IMG hospitality box - located on the other side of the stadium - in order to make contact with the Neymar camp and were spotted during their half-circuit of the corporate areas.
"Sports management giants IMG are understood to have been entertaining Neymar’s father Neymar da Silva and the £55 million-rated player’s marketing team from IMX Talent. The company is a joint venture with IMG to exploit sports business opportunities in Brazil."
The 21-year-old has long been expected to stay at Santos until after the 2014 World Cup when the club believe he will reach maximum value.
Despite his youthful years Neymar has already won 28 caps for the Brazil national team and has scored 17 goals.
He has long been linked with Barcelona and the Mail note in their report that "the Spanish giants are (still) seen as one of the favourites for his signature.
"But Abu Dhabi-owned City can afford to offer Neymar a similar package or better and have put down the first marker.
"It also might be relevant that compatriots Soriano and Begiristain used to work together at Barcelona - reported to be the preferred choice of Neymar senior for his son - and could persuade the family to make the move to Manchester instead."
