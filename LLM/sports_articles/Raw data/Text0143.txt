   	Blake Williams, son of suspended St. Louis Rams defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, is no longer with the team, FOXSports.com has learned.
  	Blake had been acting defensive coordinator for the Rams after Gregg was suspended indefinitely for his role in the New Orleans Saints' Bountygate scandal. Since Gregg hasn't been reinstated by the league, no firm decisions can be made regarding his job status. However, Blake has been looking for another job and has been telling coaches that he and his father are out in St. Louis.
  	Gregg Williams was hired by Jeff Fisher when the latter was named the Rams head coach before the 2012 season. However, once Gregg's suspension came down, Fisher handed most of his duties to Blake.
  	One of the youngest assistant coaches in the history of the NFL, Blake Williams led a young and emerging defense that finished the regular season ranked 14th in the league.
