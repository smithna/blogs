Ever since Cristiano Ronaldo admitted to being unhappy at Real in September last year, speculation has surrounded the future of the Portuguese star. His form may have been nothing short of miraculous but his Madrid-based ambitions remain plagued with vacillations.

The European Champions League glamor tie with his former club Manchester United has seen this area of unease brought into focus following a spurious report in El Pais that Real would sell Ronaldo if he didn’t commit to a new contract and after former teammate Nemanja Vidic told reporters he wouldn’t be "surprised" by a CR7 return to Old Trafford.

Whether driven by unhappiness in Spain, his love for the English Premier League, or due to stalling contract negotiations at the Santiago Bernabeu, according to some, it seems it is only a matter of time before the 28-year-old goes back to Old Trafford.

So what can we make of this speculation, and should CR7 move back to the club which made him a superstar? Let’s talk about the speculation first.

I know for a fact Ronaldo is regularly in touch with Alex Ferguson. He told me so when we met up last November in Madrid. I also know that his agent, Jorge Mendes, has a good relationship with Fergie and believes a return back to Old Trafford would improve his client’s brand and commercial revenue.

Mourinho: Whole world will stop to watch

The truth is Mendes and Ronaldo have become tired of all the infighting at Real Madrid and both of them believe all the negative energy around the club has affected the player’s image.

A return to United would allow Ronaldo to have more emotional support and also increase his chances of winning some of the individual awards he craves. After all, the Premier League is the highest profile domestic league on the planet.
