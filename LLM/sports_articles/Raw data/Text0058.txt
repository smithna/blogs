The 29-year-old secured a 6-3 6-3 6-1 victory over the Belgian to earn his 57th win in Melbourne and take him past previous record-holder Stefan Edberg.
 World No. 2 Federer, a four-time winner of the event, said he was pleased to break Edberg's Open era record, but he admitted the retired Swede is still someone he looks up to.
 "It's very nice, but he still stays my idol," Federer, who shares the record of five final appearances with Edberg, told the tournament's website.
 The 16-time major champion -- also a record -- was happy with his performance following a testing five-set clash with Gilles Simon on Wednesday.

 Third seed Novak Djokovic is into the fourth round after his Davis Cup teammate Viktor Troicki was forced to retire from their clash.
 Serbia's 2008 champion Djokovic led Troicki 6-2 when the 29th seed withdrew with a stomach issue.
 "He obviously tried his best," Djokovic said of Troicki on the ATP Tour's website.
 "It's the third round of a grand slam. It's not the way you want to finish the tournament, definitely. It's sad for him, but I have to move on."

 Czech sixth seed Tomas Berdych advanced with a straight-sets dismissal of Richard Gasquet.
 Berdych equaled his best performance at the tournament with his 6-2 7-6 (7-3) 6-2 victory over the French 28th seed, and he will meet fellow top-10 player Fernando Verdasco in the last 16.
 Spanish ninth seed Verdasco, who reached the semifinals in Melbourne in 2009, overcame Kei Nishikori of Japan 6-2 6-4 6-3.
 American eighth seed Andy Roddick fell one set behind in his match with Dutchman Robin Haase before he won a second-set tie-break and consequently the contest 2-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-2 6-2.
