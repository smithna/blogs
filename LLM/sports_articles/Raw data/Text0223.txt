STEVEN CALDWELL urged his team-mates to focus on Birminghams relegation battle rather than worry about their own futures.
 		
Citys cash-strapped owners have admitted they are open to offers for any of their first-team players, with top-scorer Marlon King and England goalkeeper Jack Butland among the big names expected to depart in this transfer window.
                                          Despite the uncertainty surrounding the side, captain Caldwell believes there is still a chance the Blues can make a late charge for promotion.
                                          He said: "We have to focus on our remaining games and salvage something from the season.
                                          We are bitterly disappointed we have underachieved and we feel we have a squad that should have done better.
                                          Sometimes you have seasons like this.
                                          We need to get as many wins as we can so we can have an outside chance of the play-offs."
                                          City had 13-goal striker King to thank for dragging them out of the Championships bottom five with a stunning volleyed winner against play-off chasing Burnley.
                                          The Blues had taken the lead when Curtis Davies, another of the clubs stars thought to be leaving, was in the right place to head in Rob Halls corner.
                                          But Burnley fought back and hit a deserved equaliser when Ross Wallace converted a penalty 11 minutes into the second half.
                                          The match looked on course to finish as a draw until Dean Marney was dismissed for a foul on Paul Robinson.
                                          Burnley midfielder Chris McCann said: It was a big decision and unfortunately it didnt go in our favour.
                                          If you look back five years or 10 years ago, those tackles would have been perfectly fine.
