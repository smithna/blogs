Stoke had hoped to take a closer look at Shea in a week-long trial, but negotiations with Major League Soccer have hit a snag, and the United States winger's arrival in England has now been delayed as talks continue between all parties.
  	The 22-year-old has not played since August following foot surgery.
  	Another possible arrival that could be scuppered due to injury is that of Pieters.
  	Stoke were due to watch PSV's Holland international defender on Friday - but because of cancelled flights, their scouting party did not make the game.
  	However, this was probably a good thing as Pieters was sent off against Zwolle, and on his way back to the changing room, smashed part of the dug-out which saw him suffer serious damage to his arm. The injury is now set to sideline him for several weeks.
