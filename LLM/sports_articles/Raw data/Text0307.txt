The New York Liberty have traded center Kia Vaughn to the Washington Mystics in a deal for the seventh pick in this WNBA draft.

Washington also received New York's second-round pick, No. 17 overall in the trade announced Wednesday.

The 6-foot-4 Vaughn, the eighth pick in 2009 out of Rutgers, averaged 5.9 points and 4.0 rebounds in 129 games over four seasons with the Liberty.

In 2011, Vaughn earned the league's Most Improved Player honor after averaging career highs of 10.1 points, 6.7 rebounds, 1.2 steals and 28.1 minutes while starting all 34 games.

The deal gives New York two first-round selections - fifth and seventh - in the April 15 draft. Washington still holds the fourth pick.
