Most of the Ravens were low-key and reflective following Sunday night's victory in the AFC championship game. Not Suggs. Even before the game, he was yelling back and forth with Patriots fans during pre-game warm-ups. 
     Then after the game, Suggs was yelling at the top of lungs as he walked through the tunnel on his way to the Ravens' locker room.

     "We came, we saw, we conquered," Suggs yelled, adding the New England Patriots were "arrogant f------!" as his booming voice echoed through the tunnel at Gillette Stadium. 
     Then, when the Ravens' locker room opened, Suggs still was yelling at anyone who would listen, and even some who didn't want to listen. 
     "We know you all had them (the Patriots) picked to win," Suggs said. "Unfortunately, the bandwagon is full, and we want you all to come in two weeks and bet against us again." 
     Suggs surely will have more to say during Super Bowl week.
