United had a real fright at Old Trafford before seeing off a gritty Reading side 2-1 to land a home FA Cup quarter-final against holders Chelsea or Middlesbrough.
                                          They are chasing a repeat of their 1999 treble of Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup with Ferguson demanding a tougher approach from his players.
                                          Goals from substitute Nani and striker Javier Hernandez edged out the relegation-threatened Royals who put the wind up United when Jobi McAnuff pulled one back in the 81st minute.
                                          And Fergie admitted: "If you don't score the goals you should do, and then concede one, then the last ten minutes can be scary.
                                          "Some of the football was fantastic and we could have scored a lot of goals.
                                          "But I have to say we really should have punished them more."
                                          But Ferguson is relishing another home tie in the last eight adding: "We have a home tie and it can't get any better than that.
                                          "You can't wish for anything more than that. No matter who we play, a home tie at Old Trafford means we have a great chance.
                                          "This was a cup tie we got out of the road and now we have a big league game on Saturday at QPR and hopefully we can keep the momentum going."
                                          United's win was marred by an ankle injury to England international Phil Jones who limped off after 42 minutes following a challenge from Reading skipper McAnuff.
                                          He will now miss Saturday's QPR clash and is also a doubt for next week's Champions League return with Real Madrid at Old Trafford.
                                          Ferguson said: "We will have to assess it in the morning. It is an ankle injury so I would imagine he would not be ready for Saturday."
                                          Substitute Nani, who was involved in a collision with an unmarked police car in Gatley, Cheshire, on Friday, was the star of the show, scoring the first in the 79th minute and setting up the second for Hernandez three minutes later.
                                         Nani said: "It wasn't a big crash and I am happy I have nothing to worry about."
