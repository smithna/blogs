 		 	Infielder Bobby Crosby signed a minor-league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers on Tuesday, continuing a trend for players represented by Paul Cohen.
  	
 	For some players, retirement just doesn't stick. See which  athletes mounted a comeback … or two.
 
   	Crosby, 33, is the third Cohen client to come out of retirement with the Brewers in recent years, following the paths of outfielders Gabe Kapler and Jim Edmonds.
  	Kapler sat out 2007 and played for three more seasons after joining the Brewers in ’08. Edmonds sat out ’09 and played well enough for the Brewers in ’10 to get traded to the Cincinnati Reds before he again retired.
  	Crosby, the 2004 American League Rookie of the Year, likely will serve as a backup to shortstop Jean Seguar. He also has played all three other infield positions, though sparingly, in his eight-year career.
  	His major-league salary will be $800,000 if he makes the club, according to a major-league source. Crosby also can earn an additional $450,000 in incentives, the source said.
