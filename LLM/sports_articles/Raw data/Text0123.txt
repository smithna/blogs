I HAD a really upsetting phone call the other day.

It was from some bloke called Bob, claiming to be from the Ford Motor Company, and it went something like this: “Hi George, it’s Bob here. We’d like our S-Max back.”

Well that’s a bit outrageous, so I put on my best Pakistani accent, which always comes out as Welsh, and said: “George who? There’s no George lives here. No sir, I think you’ve got the wrong number.”

“Come on George, stop mucking about.”

“Sorry sir, this is the Star of Rajastan. Would you like to order a takeaway? Sorry but we do not deliver.”

Well that was the end of that, or so I hoped, but next thing I got a letter. It was from Bob. He still wanted his S-Max back, and he’d signed it “Nag, nag, nag.” 

So I rang to tell him that the S-Max had been nicked by a gang of Brummies – with Aston Villa scarves, just to make it sound more convincing.

It worked too, I thought, because he said: “That’s OK. I’ll tell the garage.”

Brilliant, that way I’d get to keep the S-Max over Christmas, then I’d say it had mysteriously turned up and give it back.

No chance, because he continued: “I’ll tell the garage ... to send someone round to collect it tomorrow.”

And that was that. Next day Big Ron turned up and it was gone. I’d only had it for six months. Mind you, it was a great six months. At just two inches shorter than a Galaxy, and sitting on the same platform, you wonder what’s going through people’s heads when they choose the more expensive Galaxy.

After all, both cars have got massive boots, seven-seat capacity and, with all three rows of seats folded flat, a huge load-lugging capacity.

Personally, and because I’m only 5ft 7½in, I’d choose the S-Max because, height-wise, it’s six inches shorter and far easier to clean.

Well, that and the fact that it makes it much more car-like to drive than Mum’s school bus. 

Mind you, most of my trips in the S-Max, just like schoolkids, were spent in the back while Mrs Motormouth drove me and my mate Dave up to the curry house.

I’d always use the excuse that I needed to sit in the back to “assess its comfort and leg room”. In fact, sitting in the back of the S-Max, and I don’t mean in its third row of folding seats, is more like being chauffeured around in a stretched limo, there’s that much room.

You slide into its black leather and Alcantara seats, with red stitching, stretch out your legs, notice that there’s a conservatorysized black-tinted glass roof and it’s just magic.

The interior, in fact, is extremely posh all round, with soft-touch trim, silver-trimmed knobs and instruments and piano black inserts in the doors and dash.

With both rows of rear seats folded flat there’s a colossal 7ftdeep loading space that’s nearly 4ft wide, which makes it great for shifting big stuff around and for trips to the tip. Fold down the rear two seats and its still 3ft deep while, with both rows of seats upright, rear space is down to just 16 inches.

Even so, the whole thing is 3ft high so Mum should still be able to get most of her kids’ stuff in there by piling them on top of each other. 

That’s their toys, not the kids. 

Yep, the S-Max is one incredibly practical car, but that’s not at the expense of its drive, which, with a 2.2-litre diesel engine, is remarkably fast and smooth, thanks to a mighty 311lb of torque that provides instant power.

Meanwhile the whole car has a really solid, well-built, feel that hits you as soon as you get in, when the doors shut with a big-car thunk.

There’s really not a lot to dislike about the S-Max, it’s that good.

You get that high-up drive that mums love, lots of storage spaces, including hidden ones in the rear footwell, genuine spaciousness and decent fuel economy, too.

Ford claim an average 40mpg and, driven really, really gently it is possible to get near that. 

In the real world, though you can expect more like 34mpg, which is still not bad for a car of this size. 

Whatever Bob gives me next had better be good, because it will have a lot to live up to. I’ll let you know.
