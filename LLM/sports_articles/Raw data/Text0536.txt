Basketball Australia said Thursday that Seattle Storm forward Lauren Jackson is expected to make a full recovery from a persistent right hamstring injury after undergoing surgery in Melbourne this week.
 Jackson was advised to undergo surgery after a series of tests to ascertain the full extent of the injury, which she first injured while playing with the Australian team in the lead up to the London Olympics and aggravated playing for Seattle.
 Orthopedic surgeon David Young was quoted in a statement as saying Jackson's the surgery was ''highly successful,'' with several problems being addressed in relation to the three-time WNBA most valuable player's injury, and the medical opinion that she will make a full recovery.
 Jackson has been advised to have complete rest for three weeks, after which she is expected to be able to start a light rehabilitation program.
 Jackson was supposed to begin a three-season deal with Australian club Canberra this year, but has not been able to take the court due to her injury.
 ''I'm very happy that I've now had this operation, and I'm delighted with the medical opinion that I should be able to make a full recovery,'' Jackson said in a statement.
