FERRARI flop Felipe Massa sent out a warning to Formula Ones front-runners with a brilliant timesheet- topping run in testing.
 		
And the Brazilian is confident of a successful season, warning rival teams: With this car we are on a different planet.
                                        Massa, 32, spent last season struggling and was completely overshadowed by team-mate, double world champion Fernando Alonso.
                                          
                                          His form was so ­disappointing that Massa did well to avoid the axe, while Alonso battled valiantly, finishing three points behind triple world champ Sebastian Vettel in the drivers standings.
                                          
                                          McLarens Jenson Button had set the mark in Jerez with a stunner of a lap of 1min 18.8secs, described by Massa as incredible.
                                          
                                          But then the Ferrari No.2 topped it by a full second, even after a spin.
                                          
                                           He and his team bosses are buzzing after the new cars headline- grabbing performance.
                                         
                                          Massa (left) said: Last year we had a big struggle and compared to last years car this is totally different, a real beauty. 
                                          I know we will be able to make a srong challenge in the championship.
