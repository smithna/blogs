 		 	Free-agent right-hander Carl Pavano doesn’t figure to be signing with a new team anytime soon.
  	
 	Baseball players have been hurt in many embarrassing ways. See the weirdest, ego-bruising injuries.
 
   	Pavano, 37, recently suffered a ruptured spleen that will sideline him for 6 to 8 weeks, according to major-league sources.
  	The injury occurred when Pavano slipped and fell while shoveling snow on his driveway in Vermont, one source said.
  	Pavano’s agent, Dave Pepe, declined comment.
  	The Colorado Rockies and New York Mets were among the teams that had shown interest in Pavano, sources said.
  	Pavano did not pitch after June 1 last season due to a sore right shoulder that was caused by a bone bruise on his humerus, according to reports.
  	He enjoyed a resurgence in the two seasons prior to that, winning 26 games and averaging 222 innings for the Twins.
