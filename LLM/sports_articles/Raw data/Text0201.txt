                                          Rafa Benitez's men go to Middlesbrough on February 27 with the winners due at Old Trafford over the weekend of March 9-10.
                                          If Sir Alex Ferguson's side are looking for an omen, they were drawn against the Stamford Bridge club at the same stage in 1999 on their way to the Treble.
                                          That game was a 0-0 draw before United won 2-0 in London, eventually beating Newcastle in the final.
                                          They also met in the 2007 final, when a Didier Drogba goal secured Chelsea's 1-0 win.
                                          United's neighbours City were handed a home draw against Championship Barnsley as a reward for their 4-0 stroll against Leeds yesterday.
                                          Barnsley boss David Flitcroft, brother of former City star Garry, told Sky: "It's not sunk in yet. It won't sink in until I speak to Gaz and his lads.
                                          "The group of players that I'm working with at the moment and the staff and the football club and the supporters, they deserve to get a tie of this magnitude.
                                          "We are going to the champions of this country and I will be proud to take my players to that stadium.
                                          "The lads have deserved this and we will make sure they go there and enjoy the day and the experience.
                                          "But we want to go there and give a good account of ourselves and try and cause an upset.
                                          "This is a cup of dreams, a cup of heroes, and I do dream.
                                          "I hope we will give a great account of ourselves and I am really excited to lead the club on this occasion.
                                          "And as a coach, to pit your wits against one of the world's best excites me as well."
                                          Blackburn's reward for their shock 1-0 win at Arsenal was a trip to fellow Championship side Millwall, who ended the run of non-League Luton with a 3-0 victory.
                                          The other quarter-final will see Wigan, who won 4-1 at Huddersfield yesterday, travel to Oldham or Everton.
                                          The League One outfit, the lowest-ranked side still in the tournament, earned a visit to Goodison Park for a replay after Matt Smith scored a stoppage-time equaliser in Saturday's 2-2 draw.
                                          Wigan boss Roberto Martinez said: "It's a great tie. Oldham have been magnificent.
                                          "It is still an open game and we will follow that one with interest."
