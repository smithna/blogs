BARCELONA star Dani Alves has claimed Arsenal's Jack Wilshere can be as good as superstars Xavi and Andres Iniesta.

The Brazilian recently played against Wilshere in a friendly clash with England.

And Alves was so impressed with the midfielder's performance, he has urged Barca chiefs to bid for the 21-year-old this summer.

"He is a great player who we have met playing against Arsenal and without doubt he can reach the height of the players we have here at Barcelona like Xavi and Iniesta," he said.

Arsenal have lost stars Cesc Fabregas and Alex Song to the Spanish league leaders over the past two summers.

And boss Arsene Wenger will be bracing himself for new attempts from Barca to nick his latest midfield linchpin.

"[Wilshere] has a lot of quality and a great personality. If I was given the chance to choose, he is a player that I would sign for Barcelona," added Alves.
